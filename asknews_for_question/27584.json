This variant, known as Clade I, led the World Health Organization (WHO) to reclassify mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its spread to Sweden highlight the need for vigilance. Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University, commented on the expected spread beyond Africa, saying, 'It was only a matter of time before this spread beyond the African continent.' Meanwhile, in the US, no cases of Clade I have been reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several factors may reduce the risk of mpox Clade I spreading widely in the US, including immune defenses from previous vaccinations and infections, as well as better access to healthcare and living standards. Additionally, unlike Africa, where wild animals serve as reservoirs, the US does not have known animal vectors carrying mpox. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has adjusted the risk level for Clade I in Europe from 'very low' to 'low', notes Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, director of the agency. This change reflects the close ties between Europe and Africa, increasing the likelihood of imported cases. Clade I is considered more transmissible and severe than Clade II, which caused the global mpox outbreak that peaked in August 2022. However, experts like Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA, emphasize understanding the risks of Clade I within its context. She noted, 'The data on severity, mortality associated - all that is scarce. There are many questions about the population it's spreading in, its immune response, the transmission route, and the infectious dose.' Recent NIH findings show disparate results for the antiviral TPOXX, which did not significantly reduce the duration of symptoms of Clade I in a trial conducted in the DRC, but did correlate with lower mortality. This suggests that better medical care could reduce mpox mortality. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, of the CDC, highlighted that the advanced US healthcare system could help reduce deaths. Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Harvard, recognized the low current risk, but urged continued vigilance. He warned, 'The absolute risk in the US is currently low, although we must remain vigilant.' The CDC's proactive measures, including the strategic use of the Jynneos vaccine, appear promising.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.", "title": "Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/sweden-confirms-first-case-mpox-strain-congo-rcna166763)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202408140016.html", "article_id": "329c7383-2ff8-5339-be02-32e2e50fb322", "classification": "Health", "country": "ZA", "source_id": "allAfrica.com", "page_rank": 2703, "domain_url": "allafrica.com", "eng_title": "Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic", "entities": {"Person": ["Cheryl Walter"], "Organization": ["Africa Centres for Disease Control"], "Location": ["Africa"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["2024"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["0.1%", "3-4%"], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": ["15,132"], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": ["clade II", "mpox", "Clade I", "clade I"], "Language": [], "Science": ["Virologist"]}, "image_url": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "keywords": ["Mpox", "Africa", "Public Health Emergency", "Vaccine Availability"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-14 04:47:25+00:00", "summary": "The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.", "title": "Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[A](https://allafrica.com/stories/202408140016.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
