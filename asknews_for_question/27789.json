Salesforce also impressed with its numbers and strong outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to rise 0.7% to 41,393 points, according to broker IG, and is on track to reach its record high of over 41,400 points set on Monday. The Nasdaq-100 is also expected to rise 0.5% to 19,444 points. Nvidia's stock has been affected by investors' doubts about the company's outlook, despite analysts' positive views on its solid and positive earnings. Portfoliomanager Thomas Altmann from QC Partners said that Nvidia's outlook 'disappointed at some points.' A stock strategist noted that Nvidia's strong price increase of 150% since the beginning of the year has driven the entire market rally, but the high expectations for the company's next earnings report made it difficult to meet. Salesforce's stock rose by over 4% pre-market after the company raised its annual targets. Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity company, also exceeded expectations, but its stock fell by 2% pre-market. HP Inc's stock fell by 3% pre-market due to declining profits and missing market estimates. Dollar General's stock fell by 24% pre-market after weak earnings and lowered annual targets, while Dollar Tree fell by 9%.
