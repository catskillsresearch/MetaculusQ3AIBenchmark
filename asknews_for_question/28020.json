The decision was made after a press conference, where NASA officials stated that there was 'too much uncertainty' about the reliability of the Starliner's engines. The agency will now attempt to return the spacecraft to Earth on an unmanned test flight in October, with a simplified separation method. NASA's decision is seen as a major setback for Boeing, which has already invested billions of dollars in the Starliner program. As Steve Stich, the program leader, said, 'We are changing the planned separation sequence. We will use a simplified separation method to get us off the station faster.'
