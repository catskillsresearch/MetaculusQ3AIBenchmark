According to experts, the reduction, the first in four years, should theoretically boost hiring, but 'those scars are still quite fresh', explains Adam Stafford, CEO of recruitment platform Recruitics. Stafford believes that the rate cut will provide 'a small boost' to hiring, but warns that 'business leaders will be prudent before stepping on the accelerator'. Ryan Sutton, technology expert at recruitment firm Robert Half, agrees that the labor market could receive a push, but notes that companies will be 'cautiously optimistic'. 'I think this fall will be interesting', he reflects. Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab's director of economic research in North America, states that the rate cut reflects a renewed focus by the Federal Reserve on supporting the labor market, but does not expect it to have an immediate impact on hiring. 'A variety of factors are influencing hiring in large tech companies, and a single rate cut is unlikely to make a big difference', he explains in an email. Tech workers have faced a brutal streak of layoffs since 2023 and a cooling labor market after the pandemic hiring boom. However, experts in human resources assure that there are still promising areas for tech workers. Although tech layoffs have heavily affected employees in support areas such as HR and operations, Stafford notes that companies have invested in key tech talent this year, with jobs in data science, AI, and machine learning 'disappearing rapidly from the market'. And although hiring in the tech sector has been 'stable' and 'conservative' this year, Sutton comments that job seekers may see new opportunities soon, as those who expected rate cuts likely adjusted their budgets in August.

In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.", "title": "The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[DAS](https://en.as.com/latest_news/the-us-companies-in-the-tech-sector-with-the-largest-mass-layoffs-since-2020-n)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Investigative", "entity_relation_graph": null, "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
