For businesses, customer satisfaction is crucial, and chatbots play a significant role in achieving this. In this article, we will examine the top 4 chatbot developers of 2024, which are Chatbase, Botpress, Botsonic, and Intercom. Chatbase is a user-friendly chatbot creator that uses pre-loaded files, texts, website links, Notion pages, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) as information sources. It offers various GPT, Claude, and Gemini models, depending on the plan chosen. Chatbase's free plan is available, as well as paid plans ranging from $19 to $399 per month. Botpress is a more powerful chatbot creator than Chatbase, offering advanced features such as Large Language Model (LLM) supported natural language processing, advanced logic and flows, knowledge bases, a database, a web browser, integrations with other applications, and nearly everything else. However, this power comes with complexity, making it less intuitive than Chatbase. Botpress offers a PAYG (Pay as you go) plan, as well as a Team plan that costs $495 per month and includes many features for teams. Botsonic is a chatbot developer that offers a balance between ease of use and power. It allows users to create chatbots using various AI models and integrate them with WhatsApp and Messenger. Botsonic's standout feature is AI Agent, which enables users to create powerful bots by interacting with other tools. Intercom is a helpdesk application that stands out for its customer support features. If you're looking for a chatbot to manage customer support, Intercom is an ideal choice. It offers many features, including the ability to use your helpdesk and customer conversations as a knowledge base, as well as web pages, uploaded content, and other sources. Intercom also integrates with live chat, email, SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. However, if you're already using a helpdesk application and are satisfied with it, there's no need to switch to Intercom.", "title": "2024 y\u0131l\u0131nda \u00f6ne \u00e7\u0131kan 4 chatbot geli\u015ftiricisi", "sentiment": 1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[W](https://webrazzi.com/2024/09/16/2024-yilinda-one-cikan-4-chatbot-gelistiricisi)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Explanatory", "entity_relation_graph": null, "as_string_key": "[1]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.laptopmag.com/software/chatgpt-is-doing-something-strange-and-it-could-change-ai-chatbots-forever", "article_id": "e49f97be-05ca-54eb-bc54-a75b859de39a", "classification": "Technology", "country": "GB", "source_id": "Laptop Magazine", "page_rank": 5692, "domain_url": "laptopmag.com", "eng_title": "ChatGPT is doing something strange, and it could change AI chatbots forever", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": ["OpenAI"], "Location": [], "Nationality": [], "Date": [], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": ["o1-preview", "ChatGPT"], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQPkAH7yWxnPGwdhmLUDMS-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": ["ChatGPT", "AI", "Chatbots", "A/B testing"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-09-16 10:12:38+00:00", "summary": "OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, has been upgraded with a new series of models called o1-preview, which focuses on more 'thoughtful' and considered solutions to user prompts.
