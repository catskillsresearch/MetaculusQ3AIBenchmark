Trump said at a crowded rally in North Carolina: 'I will demand the resignation of every senior military official involved in the catastrophe in Afghanistan, they should resign immediately.' In February 2022, President Joe Biden rejected the findings of a military investigation, which concluded that 'his administration failed to prepare and respond adequately to the Taliban's takeover of power in Afghanistan.' Biden said: 'I reject those narratives,' adding: 'There was no good time to leave, but if we hadn't left, we would have had to - as they acknowledged - send more troops to hell.' He explained that 'his administration would have had to significantly increase the number of troops and thus return to this war of attrition... Therefore, this decision (to withdraw) was the most wise decision to be made.' The investigation, published by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act, found that attempts by US military leaders to plan the evacuation of embassy staff and Afghan allies were met with resistance in the White House and the State Department. It is worth noting that in August 2021, the Taliban intensified its attacks on the Afghan government forces and entered the capital Kabul on August 15, 2021. Under the cover of night on August 31, the US military began to leave Kabul, marking the end of nearly 20 years of US military presence in the country.
