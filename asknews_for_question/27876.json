Zgurtsky noted that the Pokrovsky direction remains the most complex on the front, with a daily average of 180-200 battles. He added that the Russians are trying to advance on the Pokrovsk direction, but their progress has been minimal over the past few days. This suggests that the Ukrainian military has reinforced its positions in this area. Zgurtsky also mentioned that the Russians have shifted their focus to the south, trying to advance on the Selydove direction, but their progress is not significant. He emphasized that holding Selydove is crucial for the Ukrainian military. The expert warned that the Russian advance on the south may create additional threats to other Ukrainian units in the Karlivka-Nevelske area. He also stated that the Ukrainian military has retreated to the Karlivka area, and the Russians are trying to advance along the Vovcha River, where the dynamics are high.

Pokrovsk, with a population of 59,000, has been on the front line since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it was only recently put under 'serious threat', the article states. Ukrainian authorities had hoped that an unexpected operation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region of Russia would ease pressure on the Donetsk front, but the Russian advance has accelerated. The local police and administration have already left the city, and two supermarkets have closed, with others likely to follow. Residents are queuing at banks and pension offices. On August 19, authorities called for the population to evacuate, and many have heeded the warning. 'Sobs and the chirping of domestic animals, trapped in bags and boxes for a trip to the west of Ukraine, can be heard at the train station,' The Economist describes the situation. Russian forces are now 10 km from Pokrovsk. Ukrainian commanders explain the Russian success in different ways, with some citing a lack of ammunition and others pointing to the Russian army's tactics, including small infantry attacks, planned bombs, and new types of electronic warfare. Ukrainian military officials do not say how long they can hold the city. 'It may take Russia several weeks or months to pass through the nearby cities, such as Mironovsky, Selydove, and Ukraine, which are now under attack by drones, artillery, and bombers... It seems that the destruction of Pokrovsk, like Mariupol, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka, is only a matter of time,' The Economist writes. 'What will happen next is an open question. Control over Pokrovsk and progress towards the administrative borders of the Donetsk region may be enough for Russian President Vladimir Putin to declare a political victory and begin serious negotiations. Or maybe not. Much will depend on whether Ukraine can hold onto the piece of Russia it currently occupies as a bargaining chip in these future negotiations,' the article concludes.
