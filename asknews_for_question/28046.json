Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) is priced at $10,483, less than a third of what it was worth a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 registered in November 2022. This price drop is mainly due to an excess of supply and moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose production relies heavily on lithium for batteries. In response to this unfavorable scenario, mining companies have implemented strategies to reduce costs and ensure the viability of their projects. For example, Argosy Minerals, an Australian company, suspended certain operations and restructured its team at its Rinc\u00f3n project in Salta, seeking to reduce financial risks. Similarly, Galan Lithium decided to slow down the construction of its project in Catamarca, while Lake Resources opted to reduce costs and sell non-essential assets in Jujuy and Catamarca to focus on its Kachi project. On the other hand, Arcadium Lithium, resulting from the merger between the Australian Allkem and the US-based Livent, announced that it will postpone investments in its Sal de Vida project in Catamarca, prioritizing a sequential expansion over a parallel one, with the goal of maintaining a prudent financial focus, as said, 'We are taking a cautious approach to ensure the long-term viability of our projects.'", "title": "Baja el litio y se enfr\u00edan proyectos", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[P](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/762696-baja-el-litio-y-se-enfrian-proyectos)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[5]"}, {"article_url": "https://gestion.pe/mundo/mineras-ajustan-proyectos-de-litio-en-argentina-ante-la-caida-de-precios-mineral-precios-internacionales-bateria-vehiculos-electricos-noticia", "article_id": "2e64eabc-886b-5ddb-ac45-ccb29e3fa177", "classification": "Business", "country": "PE", "source_id": "Diario Gesti\u00f3n", "page_rank": 17370, "domain_url": "gestion.pe", "eng_title": "Lithium Producers Adjust Projects in Argentina Amid Price Decline", "entities": {"Person": ["Fernando Zevallos Sulca"], "Organization": ["Galan Lithium", "Lake Resources", "CRU", "Argosy Minerals"], "Location": [], "Nationality": ["British"], "Date": ["November 2022"], "Event": [], "Money": ["US$ 10,483.00", "US$ 80,909.00"], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": ["two years", "three years"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["senior analyst"], "Number": ["50", "six", "four"], "Arms": [], "Product": ["LCE", "lithium carbonate equivalent"], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://gestion.pe/resizer/v2/CFGXDQJ44FBE7OSPKS5D7RLJL4.jpg?auth=7302927b9f23b4f49b5dd0b98d637523b348c6c1f2398267c5449ca9bf88c545&width=980&height=528&quality=75&smart=true", "keywords": ["Lithium", "Price Decline", "Argentina", "Mining Companies"], "language": "es", "pub_date": "2024-08-25 22:35:55+00:00", "summary": "The decline in international prices of lithium has led mining companies in Argentina to adjust their projects. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) grade battery is priced at US$ 10,483.00, less than a third of its value a year ago and far from the historical high of US$ 80,909.00 in November 2022. The decrease in prices is attributed to an excess of lithium supply and a moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose main component in batteries is lithium. This context has affected the 50 lithium initiatives in Argentina, of which only four are in production and six are under construction. Fernando Zevallos Sulca, senior analyst at the British consultancy CRU, stated that the increase in lithium production over the past few years, encouraged by the explosive price increase at the beginning of the decade, has resulted in a 250% increase in global production over the past three years. This imbalance between supply and demand has negatively impacted the income of producers, who are now focusing on generating cash and reducing costs to maintain financial stability. Companies such as Argosy Minerals, Galan Lithium, and Lake Resources have announced measures to reduce costs, adjust their staff, and sell non-essential assets. Despite the situation, companies in the sector have expressed their intention to continue investing in Argentina, although with possible delays in their original plans. Argentina, which has tripled its lithium production capacity over the past two years, is currently the world's fourth-largest producer of this mineral, behind Australia, Chile, and China. Zevallos Sulca predicts that production in Argentina will continue to grow and could compete with Chile's in the next decade, provided that the current projects can obtain the necessary financing, estimated at between US$ 3,500 and 4,000 million.", "title": "Mineras ajustan proyectos de litio en Argentina ante la ca\u00edda de precios", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[DG](https://gestion.pe/mundo/mineras-ajustan-proyectos-de-litio-en-argentina-ante-la-caida-de-precios-mineral-precios-internacionales-bateria-vehiculos-electricos-noticia)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[6]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.lanacion.com.ar/agencias/utilidad-de-chilena-sqm-cae-63-en-segundo-trimestre-por-retroceso-en-precio-del-litio-nid21082024", "article_id": "38cdf360-544b-5473-906e-d9a23f3ed19f", "classification": "Finance", "country": "AR", "source_id": "LA NACION", "page_rank": 2501, "domain_url": "lanacion.com.ar", "eng_title": "SQM Reports 63% Decline in Profit Due to Lithium Price Drop", "entities": {"Person": ["Ricardo Ramos"], "Organization": ["SQM", "Albemarle"], "Location": [], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["June", "second quarter of 2024", "April"], "Event": [], "Money": ["$1.6 billion", "$12,700"], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["210,000 tons", "52,300 tons"], "Time": ["second quarter", "second semester", "first semester"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["CEO"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": ["lithium carbonate equivalent", "electric vehicle batteries"], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": ["lithium"]}, "image_url": "https://resizer.glanacion.com/resizer/v2/actualiza-1-utilidad-de-chilena-sqm-cae-63percent-C4DZYPM2UNGU3DALOAAO6LNTWQ.jpg?auth=fc6b28e5e2300c522eaa917feedb078c9006c0037eab4e0b768a17e3c8c5f5e8&width=768&quality=70&smart=false", "keywords": ["Lithium", "SQM", "Profit Decline", "Electric Vehicle Batteries"], "language": "es", "pub_date": "2024-08-21 17:52:01+00:00", "summary": "SQM, the second-largest lithium producer in the world, reported a 63% decline in profit in the second quarter due to a decline in the price of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries.

SQM's CEO, Ricardo Ramos, stated that the trend of low prices is expected to continue in the second half of the year, with lithium prices in China being 20% lower than the average price observed in the second quarter of 2024. Ramos also mentioned that some lithium producers may reduce their production due to the low prices making projects economically unviable.
