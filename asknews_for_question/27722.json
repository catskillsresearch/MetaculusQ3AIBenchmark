Traders remain upbeat, but attention turns to US indicators, including GDP growth, inflation, and jobless claims. Nvidia's earnings report is the headliner, with analysts warning that a disappointing result could spark a sell-off in the sector. As Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank said, 'The rebound in stock markets after the July crunch, lower gasoline prices and the heightened prospect of near-term interest rate cuts look to have overwhelmed the impact on confidence of softening labour market indicators.' Analyst Stephen Innes noted, 'This is the one that could either lift all boats or sink the entire fleet.' Asian markets were mixed, with Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore dropping, while Tokyo, Wellington, and Taipei gained.

However, the results won't necessarily shed light on the broader AI industry and whether the tens of billions of dollars poured into it will ultimately pay off. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called Nvidia's upcoming report 'the most important tech earnings in years.' But Nvidia's results won't reveal much about the AI cloud providers, AI startups, and legacy businesses scrambling to make money from AI tools. The primary market for Nvidia's AI chips are companies training the biggest and most sophisticated AI models, but most companies use them for inference, which is a bigger long-term opportunity with more competition for Nvidia. Daniel Newman, principal analyst of Futurum Research, expects another one to three years of investment in AI infrastructure before the 'Walmart-like use cases' of generative AI are known. For now, there are plenty of companies starting to incorporate AI into their software and operations, but creating viable business models is 'still somewhat opaque.' Stock watchers will focus on Nvidia's shares, but many on Wall Street are wondering whether generative AI can ever really become profitable.

However, many indicators pointed to a positive trend. A notable highlight was the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on employment and wages, which made headlines. Analysts from Goldman Sachs predicted a significant job reduction from April 2023 to March 2024. Although the report's release initially garnered less attention, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell's speech the following Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, kept the financial world on edge. Powell's speech confirmed expectations of a relaxation of monetary policy by the Fed, which the markets had already largely priced in. Small businesses experienced a surge in stock prices as a result. This week's data on PCE inflation and the August employment report will be crucial. However, the focus will also be on corporate developments, such as those at Nvidia. Nvidia, the chip giant, will release its highly anticipated second-quarter report on Wednesday evening. Experts from Option Research & Technology Services predict an operating profit of 63 cents per share for this period, a significant increase from the 21 cents of the previous year's quarter. Nvidia is seen as an important indicator of the market's condition around artificial intelligence, whose growth has continued to boost the S&P 500. Nvidia's results and forecasts could either propel the overall market upward or dampen it with disappointing numbers. Although the company has consistently exceeded expectations in the past six quarters, there are uncertainties. Recent rumors about delays in the next generation of AI chips have cast a shadow. Despite this, investors have shown confidence, as the stock was able to recover losses by the end of the month. The semiconductor industry has undergone significant changes this year. Intel continues to struggle with market share losses and disappointed with both revenue and profit in its latest report. The company aims to counteract this with cost-cutting measures and dividend payments. This week, Intel will participate in the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. The importance of the international market is underscored by Taiwan Semiconductor, which has become the largest publicly traded company outside the US. Although the company's full quarterly results are not expected until October, a look at the interim report in September is worthwhile.
