Moraes has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the TSE acted within its 'police powers' to produce reports on illicit activities, and that the reports were simply a description of publicly available social media posts. 'The reports simply described the illicit posts made on social media, in an objective manner, as they were directly related to the investigations into digital militias,' Moraes said. 'Several of these reports were attached to these investigations and others connected to them, and sent to the Federal Police for further investigation, always with the knowledge of the Attorney General's Office.'", "title": "Entenda a acusa\u00e7\u00e3o contra o ministro Alexandre de Moraes", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[CB](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/politica/2024/08/6920222-entenda-a-acusacao-contra-o-ministro-alexandre-de-moraes.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Investigative", "as_string_key": "[8]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.otvfoco.com.br/anuncio-traz-bomba-da-poupanca-e-atinge-aposentados-em-2024", "article_id": "03b7b4ec-4faa-58b6-b2a8-2be1b69a2f31", "classification": "Politics", "country": "BR", "source_id": "TV Foco", "page_rank": 288825, "domain_url": "otvfoco.com.br", "eng_title": "Alexandre de Moraes Under Fire: STF's Inability to Resolve Retiree Issue", "entities": {"Person": ["Alexandre de Moraes"], "Organization": ["STF", "Supreme Federal Court", "banks"], "Location": [], "Nationality": ["Brazilians"], "Date": ["2024", "late 1980s", "2009"], "Event": ["Collor 1", "Collor 2", "Bresser", "Ver\u00e3o"], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["70,000"], "Time": ["15 years"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["Minister"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": ["Folha de S.

However, a recent announcement involving the STF has caused a stir, affecting retirees in 2024. According to the Folha de S. Paulo, the STF has been unable to reach a consensus on the issue, which dates back to the late 1980s. The government implemented several economic plans to combat inflation, including the Bresser, Ver\u00e3o, Collor 1, and Collor 2 plans. These plans were meant to correct the savings of thousands of Brazilians, many of whom are now retirees, who have filed lawsuits against banks to be reimbursed. Despite the case reaching the STF in 2009, the court has yet to deliver a verdict, leaving thousands of retirees waiting for 15 years. As the STF is known for resolving an average of 70,000 cases annually, this delay is unprecedented. Alexandre de Moraes, who has always been in favor of retirees, is now facing criticism for his inability to resolve the issue. The situation remains unresolved in 2024.", "title": "Alexandre de Moraes sem ch\u00e3o: An\u00fancio envolvendo o Supremo traz bomba da poupan\u00e7a e atinge aposentados em 2024", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[TVF](https://www.otvfoco.com.br/anuncio-traz-bomba-da-poupanca-e-atinge-aposentados-em-2024)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.osul.com.br/ministro-do-supremo-alexandre-de-moraes-permite-que-o-ex-diretor-da-policia-rodoviaria-federal-silvinei-vasques-saia-da-penitenciaria-para-participar-de-prova-da-oab", "article_id": "bba0ab09-73aa-5ef1-bf9c-8b82d60225af", "classification": "Politics", "country": "BR", "source_id": "Jornal O Sul", "page_rank": 266228, "domain_url": "osul.com.br", "eng_title": "Supreme Court Minister Allows Ex-PRF Director to Take Bar Exam from Prison", "entities": {"Person": ["Silvinei Vasques", "Vasques", "Alexandre de Moraes"], "Organization": ["Supreme Court", "Federal Highway Police", "PRF"], "Location": ["Bras\u00edlia", "Papuda Penitentiary Complex", "Santa Catarina", "Rio Grande do Norte", "Rio Grande do Sul", "Federal District"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["July 28", "July 26", "September 22", "2023"], "Event": ["39th Bar Exam", "political violence", "41st Unified Bar Exam", "Operation Constitution Citizen"], "Money": [], "Law": ["prevarication", "electoral fraud"], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["Minister"], "Number": ["10"], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://www.osul.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/silvineis.jpg", "keywords": ["Supreme Court", "Bar Exam", "PRF", "Brazil", "Operation Constitution Citizen"], "language": "pt", "pub_date": "2024-07-19 00:19:47+00:00", "summary": "Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes allowed the temporary release of former PRF (Federal Highway Police) director Silvinei Vasques to take the 41st Unified Bar Exam, a test required for lawyers in Brazil.
