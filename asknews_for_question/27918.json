The date was revealed after an analysis conducted by NASA and Boeing. If everything goes well, the spacecraft will be undocked from the ISS at 19h04 Bras\u00edlia time. It will travel back and is expected to land at the White Sands spaceport in New Mexico after six hours. The location was one of the main training areas for the astronauts of the space shuttle. In a statement, NASA officials explained that the Starliner will return to Earth autonomously and without a crew. 'The ground teams can remotely control the spacecraft if necessary during the necessary maneuvers for safe undocking, re-entry, and landing with the help of parachutes in the southeastern United States,' they added. This is not the first time the Starliner has returned to Earth autonomously. It happened during the uncrewed flight tests in 2019 and 2022 - in the first one, the spacecraft did not reach the ISS, but in the second, it did. The Starliner was launched to the ISS on June 5, carrying astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the orbital laboratory. The spacecraft was docked to the station the next day, but suffered helium leaks and failures in five of its 28 thrusters. Since then, NASA and Boeing have extended the stay of the duo on the ISS while analyzing the incident, and concluded that it was too dangerous to use the Starliner to bring them back to Earth.
