The agreement aims to secure a piece of land in the Gulf of Aden for Ethiopia, in exchange for recognizing Somaliland as an independent republic. Ethiopia has already sent a diplomat to Hargeisa, marking a significant step in diplomatic recognition. In response, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud visited Cairo, seeking Egyptian support, and a defense agreement was signed between the two countries in August, with Egypt sending military equipment and troops to Mogadishu.

However, observers believe that Egyptian troops may be redeployed to the border between Somalia and Ethiopia. The situation is complicated by the presence of Ethiopian forces in Somalia, which are fighting against terrorist groups. Ethiopia claims that it 'cannot remain idle while other subjects destabilize the region', accuses Somalia of conspiring with Egypt, and is preparing to 'take measures to respond'. Experts believe that the tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia in Somalia, as well as the issues of Somaliland's existence and access to maritime ports, are a continuation of the longstanding rivalry between Addis Ababa and Cairo over the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile. Egypt views the dam as a threat to its existence, as the river provides 85% of the country's water consumption.

'Cairo is ready to take all necessary measures to protect its right to exist, as well as the rights and interests of its citizens.'

'It would not have been possible for a nation [Egypt] with so much history and rights to Nile waters to remain silent when faced with the absurdity that Ethiopia has shown us in recent years,' said Mustafa Al Fiqy, a retired career Egyptian diplomat.

Egypt has countered by complaining in a letter to the UN Security Council about what it called Ethiopia's unilateral policies over the Gerd. The heightened tension between Egypt and Ethiopia would further destabilise the Horn of Africa and the larger East Africa region, which is already shaken by a 16-month civil war in Sudan and attacks on Red Sea shipping by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

However, Egypt has been cooperating with Turkey in the region, particularly in Somalia and Ethiopia. Turkey has been actively involved in the region, with a strong military and economic presence. It has a defense agreement with Somalia and has been providing military training and aid to the Somali army. Turkey's relations with Ethiopia date back to 130 years and include several security and economic agreements. Turkey has been playing a mediating role between Egypt and Ethiopia, helping to resolve their differences. The Egyptian move is seen as a response to Ethiopia's fifth filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which has deepened tensions between the two countries. The Egyptian government has expressed its opposition to Ethiopia's unilateral actions, and the two countries are engaged in negotiations over the dam's impact on Egypt's water rights. Turkey's role in mediating between Egypt and Ethiopia is seen as crucial in resolving the dispute.

According to a statement by the Turkish presidency, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed by phone, discussing the relations between Turkey and Ethiopia, regional and global developments, and the dispute with Somalia. Erdogan emphasized that Turkey will continue its efforts to end the tension between Somalia and Ethiopia, and that Ethiopia's steps to address Somalia's concerns about its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 'will make the process easier.' The Turkish Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, said that the foreign ministers of Somalia and Ethiopia will meet in Ankara this week to discuss the dispute over the port agreement. The relations between the two neighbors, Ethiopia and Somalia, have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed the agreement with Somaliland in January 2023, which allows Somaliland to use the region's coastline on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes for 50 years, in exchange for Ethiopia's recognition of Somaliland's independence. In April 2023, Somalia announced the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador, and closed the Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa, the largest city and capital of Somaliland, and Galkayo, the capital of the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Somalia declared that the agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland is 'unlawful' and constitutes a threat to its sovereignty. Ethiopia defended the agreement, saying it 'will not affect any party or country.' Ethiopia lost its ports on the Red Sea in the early 1990s, after the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. Somaliland, which has not been recognized as a state since its declaration of independence from Somalia in 1991, operates as a separate administrative, political, and security entity, with the central government unable to exert control over the region. Turkey has launched a mediation initiative between Somalia and Ethiopia, and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has held a meeting with his Ethiopian and Somali counterparts in Ankara in July. Fidan said that 'the tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia will end when Ethiopia reaches the seas through Somalia, as long as Ethiopia's recognition of Somalia's territorial integrity and sovereignty is guaranteed.' Turkey has strong relations with both countries and has become a close ally of Somalia, providing schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and offering scholarships to Somalis to study in Turkish universities. In 2017, Turkey opened its largest military base outside the country in Mogadishu, and in February this year, it signed a defense and economic cooperation agreement with Somalia, which includes the deployment of Turkish naval forces to protect Somalia's coastline, after the two countries agreed on Turkey's operations to explore oil and gas in three areas off Somalia's coast.", "title": "\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0636\u064a\u0641 \u062c\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0627\u0648\u0636\u0627\u062a \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0625\u062b\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0627", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[\u0635\u062d](https://aawsat.com/node/5049604)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "http://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2024/Aug/197496/somali_officials_in_t%C3%BCrkiye_for_urgent_talks_with_ethiopia_over_somaliland_port_deal.aspx", "article_id": "a2291877-6e06-540c-bfd6-b4e025838410", "classification": "Politics", "country": "SO", "source_id": "Hiiraan Online", "page_rank": 187657, "domain_url": "hiiraan.com", "eng_title": "Somali officials in T\u00fcrkiye for urgent talks with Ethiopia over Somaliland port deal", "entities": {"Person": ["Ahmed Moallim Fiqi", "Hakan Fidan", "Recep Tayyip Erdogan"], "Organization": [], "Location": ["Somaliland"], "Nationality": ["Turkish", "Somali", "T\u00fcrkiye"], "Date": ["July"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["President", "Foreign Minister"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://hiiraan.com/comments/comments.gif", "keywords": ["Somalia", "Ethiopia", "T\u00fcrkiye", "Somaliland"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-11 02:03:00+00:00", "summary": "Somali officials have arrived in T\u00fcrkiye for urgent talks with Ethiopia over a contentious port access deal with Somaliland.
