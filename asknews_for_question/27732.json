The incident was the first confirmed intrusion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft. 'There is no doubt that a military aircraft violating territorial airspace sends a very strong message,' a senior official of the Self-Defense Forces said. The Japanese government has lodged a protest with China over the violation, which prompted the SDF to scramble fighter jets. Some officials suspect the Chinese plane 'simply took a wrong course and entered Japan's territorial airspace,' while others believe it was a deliberate act of intelligence gathering. The plane was likely collecting information on two Air SDF monitoring radar facilities in the area. 'The aircraft that violated Japan's airspace this time has been gathering information on the SDF radar frequencies,' the ministry official said. 'It is natural to assume that the aircraft entered the airspace while concentrating on intelligence gathering.' The official said Japan must be vigilant about the fact that Chinese military aircraft are conducting intelligence gathering activities so close to the airspace of the Japanese mainland. A senior SDF official was perplexed about the latest intrusion, saying 'I don't know why it happened at this time.' Some speculate that the move was Beijing's way of responding to an earlier incident in July, where a Japanese vessel sailed through Chinese territorial waters without permission. 'The Chinese side may have suspected that the Japanese side had other intentions,' a diplomatic source said. Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, said the reason for the latest airspace violation was not immediately known, but 'I do not see any merit for China to militarily intimidate Japan at this time.'
