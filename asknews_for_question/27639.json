Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that the central bank does not need inflation to be below 2% before cutting rates, and noted that the labor market has cooled 'significantly'. Investors will also be watching company earnings reports from Delta and PepsiCo, seeking signs about the health of US consumers before the quarterly reports from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Here are five highlights for Thursday: The main event of the day is the release of the US consumer price index (CPI) in the morning. Analysts expect the data to show the smallest consecutive increases in core inflation since mid-July last year, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. The expectation is for a 0.2% increase in the core index for June, for the second consecutive month. The broader index is expected to show a smaller 0.1% increase, partly due to lower gasoline prices. A result like this would help solidify projections that the Fed will start cutting rates in September, marking the first step in reversing its most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the focus is on retail sales data for May. Median estimate in a Bloomberg survey points to a 4.4% annual increase, following a 2.2% increase in the previous month. The monthly index is expected to show a 0.5% decline, according to projections. Global stocks rose on Wednesday, as traders prepare for a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
