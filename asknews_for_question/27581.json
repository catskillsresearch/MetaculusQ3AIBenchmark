Brockman, known as 'GDB' within the company, was a key ally of CEO Sam Altman when he was briefly removed from his position last year.

Schulman, who was a researcher at the company focused on training AI models, said in a post on X that he will focus on Anthropic's security, but that concerns about this issue did not motivate his decision to leave. 'To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,' he said, referring to the alignment of AI with human interests. 'On the contrary, the company's leaders have committed to investing heavily in this area.' OpenAI stated that the team is 'grateful' for Schulman's work, including his alignment research. 'His passion and hard work have established a solid foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and in the broader field,' a spokesperson said. Schulman was hailed as the architect of ChatGPT, the popular chatbot of OpenAI. However, he said he receives 'too much credit' for the tool and cited the work of the entire team.
