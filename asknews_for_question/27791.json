Dylan Mattole, a cannabis cultivator, believes that rescheduling is an incremental improvement, but does not address the major issue of marijuana remaining illegal at the federal level. He suggests that de-scheduling would be a more effective solution. Ross Gordon, policy director for the Humboldt County Growers Alliance, shares similar concerns, stating that rescheduling could lead to greater regulation due to the FDA's possible involvement. Both men agree that the cannabis industry needs to emulate other craft industries, but this requires the ability to ship products directly to consumers, which is currently illegal under federal law. The federal hearing on rescheduling is set for December 2, and the final decision will likely occur after the next president is elected.

He suggests that the DEA has placed too much emphasis on a drug's currently accepted medical use (CAMU) in scheduling decisions, which he labels the 'Tyranny of Science' and the 'Tyranny of the Majority.' Mikos proposes a new approach to scheduling that considers all three criteria - a drug's abuse potential, its dependence liability, and whether or not it has a CAMU - to determine where a drug belongs among the statute's five schedules. He believes that this approach would foster more rational administrative scheduling decisions and enable the agency to remove drugs like marijuana, psilocybin, or MDMA from Schedule I if their abuse potential and dependence liability so warrant.", "title": "While Marijuana Will Soon be Rescheduled, the Federal Government's Drug Scheduling System Remains Tyrannical", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[VU](https://law.vanderbilt.edu/while-marijuana-will-soon-be-rescheduled-the-federal-governments-drug-scheduling-system-remains-tyrannical)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[2]"}, {"article_url": "https://thehill.com/newsletters/health-care/4808566-gop-protests-marijuana-rescheduling", "article_id": "842c65d5-640b-5790-9389-159b513710de", "classification": "Politics", "country": "US", "source_id": "The Hill", "page_rank": 583, "domain_url": "thehill.com", "eng_title": "GOP protests marijuana rescheduling", "entities": {"Person": ["Karen O'Keefe"], "Organization": ["Marijuana Policy Project", "White House", "GOP", "Republicans", "Congress"], "Location": [], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["May"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": ["CSA", "Schedule III", "Controlled Substances Act"], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["director of state policies", "state attorneys general"], "Number": ["40,000", "11"], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": ["marijuana"], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/65652010b55a53.28837298-e1714066390106.jpeg?w=1280", "keywords": ["Marijuana", "Rescheduling", "Controlled Substances Act", "GOP", "White House"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-02 21:24:15+00:00", "summary": "The comment period for the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act has ended, with over 40,000 comments submitted, mostly in favor of the change.
