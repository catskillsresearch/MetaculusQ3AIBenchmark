All-in yields are attractive across fixed income sectors, and real interest rates are near historical highs. The current environment, with a too-close-to-call election and trillions of investable assets parked in cash, presents a chance for municipal bonds to shine. The increase in supply from Covid-19 stimulus funds has softened muni markets, creating attractive buying opportunities in the new issue market. The forward pull in supply will likely lead to a slowdown as the year ends, which should create an imbalance in the other direction, pushing up prices. With the Treasury curve remaining inverted to flat, investors have $6.4 trillion parked in money market funds, but municipal bonds offer an attractive return, particularly on an after-tax basis. The muni curve is much steeper than the Treasury curve, and the muni-to-treasury ratio indicates a spread at its widest level since Fall 2023. As the Fed is expected to kick off an easing cycle, bond inflows are shifting from shorter- to longer-term maturities, and we expect this trend to accelerate. The fundamentals that support local governments are stronger today than ever, with state reserves and rainy-day funds at their highest levels in decades. Munis are a high-quality asset class, with a strong fundamental risk profile, and local governments are financially stronger today than they were before previous downturns.", "title": "It's a Great Moment for Municipal Bonds.

The yield curve is showing signs of a return to normality, and bond rates are falling sharply in expectation of rate cuts. However, the market may be pricing in too much optimism, with the Fed expected to cut rates by 225 basis points by the end of 2025.

However, the curve suddenly returned to its normal shape on September 4, with the 10-year Treasury yield surpassing the 2-year yield. This brief period of normalcy was short-lived, as the curve inverted again on Wednesday, with the spread between the two yields widening in favor of the longer-term bonds during the Thursday and Friday sessions. If the yield curve's inversion signals a recession, does its return to normality mean the threat has passed? The yield curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the yields of bonds with different maturities, such as the difference between the yields of 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds. Typically, the yield curve is upward-sloping, with shorter-term bonds yielding less than longer-term bonds. However, when the curve inverts, shorter-term bonds yield more than longer-term bonds, causing concern in the markets. A rising yield curve is often a sign of high inflation, as higher inflation expectations drive investors to demand higher yields for longer-term bonds to compensate for the expected erosion of purchasing power. The yield curve typically inverts when investors expect a recession, triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation. The curve usually returns to its normal shape when the Fed begins to lower interest rates or when the market expects this to happen. Some economists believe that the yield curve's inversion often precedes a recession, while others argue that it is a reliable indicator of an impending downturn. The current yield curve has been inverted for a record 793 days, or approximately 26 months, without a recession occurring. Even if the yield curve returns to its normal shape and stabilizes for a long period, this does not necessarily mean that the economy will not experience a downturn. Historical data show that problems often begin when long periods of inversion end. The most recent four recessions (in 1990, 2001, 2007, and 2020) began after the yield curve returned to its normal shape, with the downturn starting 3-6 months later, according to 'Dow Jones Market Data.' In the coming months, it will become clear whether the Fed's interest rate hikes have pushed the economy into a recession or whether it has successfully controlled inflation without a downturn, according to 'Jim Reid,' head of global economics and thematic research at 'Deutsche Bank.' Time will also reveal whether the yield curve has lost its role as a leading indicator in this economic cycle or if it has simply sent out its warning signals earlier than in other cycles.", "title": "\u0631\u0643\u0648\u062f \u0648\u0625\u062e\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a .. \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0639\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0647\u061f", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[AI](https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/1753106)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "entity_relation_graph": null, "as_string_key": "[8]"}, {"article_url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4133881-fed-shouldnt-react-to-one-number-chicago-feds-goolsbee-says", "article_id": "80792b33-e45f-5229-81fc-1c8db51fac90", "classification": "Finance", "country": "US", "source_id": "Seeking Alpha", "page_rank": 605, "domain_url": "seekingalpha.com", "eng_title": "Fed shouldn't react to one number, Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says (NASDAQ:TLT)", "entities": {"Person": ["Austan Goolsbee"], "Organization": ["FOMC", "Chicago Fed", "Federal Reserve"], "Location": ["U.S."], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["Monday", "September", "Friday"], "Event": ["recession", "pandemic"], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": ["two years"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["President"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": ["yield curve"], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/162837478/image_162837478.jpg?io=getty-c-w750", "keywords": ["Federal Reserve", "Jobs Data", "Recession", "FOMC"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-05 13:00:01+00:00", "summary": "Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the jobs data reported on Friday does not indicate a recession.
