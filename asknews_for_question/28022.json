The crew, consisting of NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A at 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission marked the second operational launch of the Commercial Crew Program. The Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully docked at the International Space Station on April 24 at 5:08 a.m. EDT (0908 GMT), making history as the first used SpaceX capsule to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab. The crew will spend the next six months on the station, conducting scientific research and experiments. 'It was a great day,' said NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, commander of the Crew-2 mission, after the successful docking. The Crew-2 astronauts have now opened the final hatch between their spacecraft and the space station, and are preparing to enter the station. The mission is a significant milestone for SpaceX and NASA, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket. The Crew-2 astronauts will spend the next six months on the International Space Station, conducting scientific research and experiments, and will return to Earth in October 2024. 'We are thrilled to have the Crew-2 astronauts on board the International Space Station,' said NASA Administrator, 'This mission is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the SpaceX and NASA teams.'
