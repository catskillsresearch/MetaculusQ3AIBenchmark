A 'lock-up agreement' has prevented Trump and other insiders from selling their shares since TMTG began trading publicly in March. However, the lock-up is set to expire later this week, and Trump has stated that he will not sell his shares. Trump's decision not to sell has caused a mini-rally for the stock, which rose 11.8% after his announcement. Despite this, experts warn that the stock could drop by over 80% if Trump were to sell his shares, as it is highly volatile and tends to move with investors' expectations for Trump's re-election chances. TMTG relies heavily on advertising for revenue, which is miniscule, and the company has incurred significant losses in recent quarters. Trump's Truth Social platform has struggled to gain traction, with a mainly conservative audience and a lax approach to content moderation. 'There is also a lot of hate speech and extremism on the platform due to their lax approach to content moderation,' said Roxana Muenster, a doctoral student at Cornell University.
