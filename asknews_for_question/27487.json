The minutes stated that 'the majority' of policymakers 'noted that if the data continues to appear as expected, it would be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.' The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate at 5.3% in July, which is the highest level in nearly a quarter century. Market participants have already considered it certain that the Federal Reserve will announce its first rate cut in four years when it meets on September 17-18. A rate cut by the Federal Reserve would ultimately lead to a decrease in car loan and mortgage interest rates, and could also lead to an increase in stock prices. The meeting minutes also highlighted that 'many' policymakers believe that the current interest rate stance is restrictive, while 'a few' participants argued that leaving the interest rate unchanged would increase pressure on the economy. Despite all Federal Reserve officials agreeing to keep the interest rate steady in July, the minutes noted that 'many' policymakers believed that the progress in lowering inflation, combined with rising unemployment rates, 'provided a reasonable argument for reducing the 25-basis-point target range.' The Federal Reserve maintained its monetary policy settings for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. In its policy statement, the central bank said it is 'attentive to risks on both sides of its dual mandate,' a change from its June statement, which said it was 'highly attentive' to inflation risks. Although the Federal Reserve reiterated that it does not expect to cut interest rates until it has more confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the post-meeting press conference effectively confirmed a rate cut in September. Powell said, 'We are approaching the point where we would be cutting rates,' and added that cutting interest rates might be considered in September. He also noted that there was 'a real discussion' about cutting interest rates at the July meeting. Powell's cautious comments and the soft labor market data allowed the markets to price in a 25-basis-point rate cut in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 50-basis-point rate cut had risen to nearly 50% earlier in August.

However, they noted that a rate cut in September could be appropriate if the data continues to come in as expected.

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July 30-31 meeting stated that 'the vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.'

'These factors included a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic.' The softening labor market was also responsible for some of the slowing inflation by putting less upward pressure on wages. Going forward, officials were watching for developments on both the inflation and employment sides of their mandate. 'Some participants noted that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration,' the minutes read.

The US interest rate has been at 5.5% since July 2023, after the Federal Reserve kept it steady for eight consecutive meetings. The data on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which will be released on August 30, and the employment report outside the agricultural sector, which will be released on September 6, will play a crucial role in the Federal Reserve's decision at its next meeting on September 17-18. Gold markets are retreating from a record high as investors await signs of a rate cut. The latest data for July was reassuring, with the economy showing signs of strength and resilience, whether it was the decline in inflation, which is gradually decreasing, despite not yet reaching the target level of 2%, or the positive numbers for the Producer Price Index (PPI) and retail sales, which were stronger than expected, or the weekly unemployment benefits, which fell for the second consecutive week. While the Federal Reserve is still holding back on cutting interest rates, major central banks have already taken this step. The Bank of Canada was the first major central bank to cut interest rates, on June 5, by 0.25% to 4.75%, and then again on July 24, by 0.25% to 4.5%. After the release of the Canadian inflation data for July yesterday, which was 2.5% in line with expectations, the Bank of Canada remains on the right track to cut interest rates for the third consecutive meeting in the coming month. The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time in five years on June 6, by 0.25% to 3.75%, after keeping it steady for five consecutive meetings. On August 1, the Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5%, after keeping it steady for seven consecutive meetings. The Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates twice this year, in March and June, by 0.25% each time, leaving interest rates at 1.25%. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25% on August 8, after keeping it steady for eight consecutive meetings at 5.5% since May 2023. The Swedish Riksbank cut interest rates by 0.25% to 3.5% yesterday, for the second time this year, after cutting it 0.25% also in May. According to ATFX MENA's chief market analyst, Kabi Dahdoh, the Jackson Hole conference may give some indications on the direction of the Federal Reserve. Dahdoh added in an interview with Al Arabiya Business that the employment data is the key in determining the percentage of interest rate cut. He explained that with the start of the series of interest rate cuts, investors are now monitoring the US dollar.", "title": "\u0647\u0644 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0631 \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a\" \u0625\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \"\u062c\u0627\u0643\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0648\u0644\" \u0644\u062e\u0641\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0626\u062f\u0629\u061f", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[AAN](https://www.alarabiya.net/aswaq/special-stories/2024/08/21/%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF%D8%A9)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[9]"}], "news knowledge": [{"article_url": "https://www.livemint.com/economy/us-fed-must-go-big-with-50-bps-interest-rate-cut-in-september-or-risk-recession-experts-11723731271045.html", "article_id": "f6da15aa-0682-568b-a980-0fbe9af8a9cf", "classification": "Finance", "country": "IN", "source_id": "mint", "page_rank": 1357, "domain_url": "livemint.com", "eng_title": "US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": ["US central bank", "Fed", "US Federal Reserve"], "Location": ["Wall Street"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["September"], "Event": ["economic storm"], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["50 basis point", "5.25-5.50%"], "Time": ["12 months"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/15/600x338/2-0-99427245-FederalReserve-4C--0_1681710281513_1723731369396.jpg", "keywords": ["US Fed", "Interest Rate Cut", "Recession", "Federal Reserve"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-15 14:18:01+00:00", "summary": "Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession.
