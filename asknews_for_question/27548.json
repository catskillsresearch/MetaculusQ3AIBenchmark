However, the level of danger posed by mpox is uncertain, and the mortality rate varies depending on the strain. In Africa, the disease has been present since 1970 and has a mortality rate estimated between 1% and 10%. In contrast, in Western countries, the mortality rate is much lower, around 0.2%. According to virologist Antoine Gessain, the risk to humans depends largely on the quality of healthcare in the region. In Africa, where the disease is more prevalent, the mortality rate is higher due to factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to proper medical care. The current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a mortality rate of 3.6%, would likely be lower if the virus were to spread to Western countries. The disease is also more contagious in areas with poor healthcare and among vulnerable populations, such as children and adults with compromised immune systems. The different strains of the virus, known as clades, also contribute to the complexity of the situation. The current outbreak in the DRC is caused by the clade 1, while the 2022-2023 outbreak was caused by the clade 2. The situation has led to confusion in the media, with some outlets describing the new subvariant 1b as more deadly than previous ones, without sufficient evidence to support this claim. According to virologist Marion Koopmans, 'we read in the main media things that are quite categorical about the gravity or danger of the new subvariant 1b, without much to back them up.'

The WHO is not taking any concrete actions, but rather wants to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' by the end of July. There are currently no known cases of the Klade I in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The Mpox virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and can cause skin rash, fever, and in severe cases, death, especially in children. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but notes that many cases may go undetected due to lack of testing capacity. The WHO had previously declared a PHEIC for Mpox in July 2022, but lifted it in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, vaccine supply remains a challenge.", "title": "ROUNDUP: WHO ruft wegen Mpox weltweite Notlage aus", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[Y](https://de.finance.yahoo.com/nachrichten/roundup-who-ruft-wegen-mpox-174103254.html)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment/index.html", "article_id": "19487b1a-1558-5073-9245-a46c4d20a1c4", "classification": "Health", "country": "US", "source_id": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "page_rank": 97, "domain_url": "cdc.gov", "eng_title": "Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": ["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "CDC"], "Location": ["DRC", "Democratic Republic of Congo"], "Nationality": [], "Date": [], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": ["two weeks"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": ["MSM"], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": ["genomic data", "clade IIb mpox", "epidemiologic data", "clinical severity", "clade I mpox epidemiology", "epidemiologic", "clade I mpox"]}, "image_url": "https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/08/QA_mpox_RA_thumbnail.PNG?_=71940", "keywords": ["Mpox", "CDC", "Risk Assessment", "Democratic Republic of Congo"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-14 04:00:00+00:00", "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States.

The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States.
