According to a report by the New York Times, US President Joe Biden approved a secret nuclear strategy in March, which for the first time directs American deterrence towards China, focusing on China's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal. The strategy also aims to prepare the US for potential coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said, 'The US is promoting the narrative of a Chinese nuclear threat and finding excuses for gaining a strategic advantage.' She added, 'The facts have proven that the US has been constantly stirring up the so-called Chinese nuclear threat theory in recent years.' The US has been updating its nuclear strategy every four years, and it is highly classified, with only a few printed copies distributed to national security officials and defense leaders. In June, the US National Security Council's director for arms control and non-proliferation, Berne Fadi, mentioned the document, which for the first time examines whether the US is ready to respond to simultaneous or sequential nuclear crises using a mix of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. Fadi said the new strategy confirms 'the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea at the same time.' The White House stated that the secret nuclear strategy approved by Biden this year is not a response to a specific country or threat, but rather a constant US concern about China's nuclear expansion. According to a Pentagon report released in October 2023, China's nuclear arsenal currently includes over 500 active nuclear warheads, which is expected to increase to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, numbers also reported by the US and Russia.", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0628\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0642\u0644\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u062a\u062e\u0635\u0647\u0627! ..\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0629", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[\u0628\u0631](https://ar.pressbee.net/show8531195.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[4]"}, {"article_url": "https://russian.rt.com/world/news/1357874-zaharova-yaponiya-bezyadernyi-status", "article_id": "0922efd7-69ac-5f65-8f15-157bc076e08c", "classification": "Politics", "country": "RU", "source_id": "RT", "page_rank": 591, "domain_url": "rt.com", "eng_title": "Russia Concerned Over Possible Erosion of Japan's Non-Nuclear Status", "entities": {"Person": ["Sergey Lavrov", "Zakharova", "Maria Zakharova"], "Organization": ["US State Department", "Foreign Ministry"], "Location": ["Far East", "Southeast Asia"], "Nationality": ["Russian"], "Date": [], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["Foreign Minister"], "Number": [], "Arms": ["nuclear weapons"], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://russian.rt.com/static/blocks/og-img/pl-17.jpg", "keywords": ["Russia", "Japan", "Non-Nuclear Status", "US Nuclear Weapons"], "language": "ru", "pub_date": "2024-08-22 00:42:14+00:00", "summary": "Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova expressed concern over the possible erosion of Japan's non-nuclear status.

The plan, which is updated every four years, also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. The NYT reported that the document is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear threats. The NYT noted that the possibility of adversaries coordinating nuclear threats to surpass the US nuclear arsenal seemed remote in the past, but explained that the 'emerging association' between Russia and China and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine have changed Washington's thinking. The change is also attributed to China's nuclear ambitions. China's nuclear expansion is advancing at a faster pace than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous estimates, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The Department of Defense's annual report on China's military power calculated that China's nuclear arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its army is 'basically complete' by then. The NYT also reported that Washington is concerned about the paralysis of talks with China on nuclear security improvements. There was an exchange on the topic between the two countries last fall, but from Beijing, it has been suggested, according to the NYT, that there is no interest in continuing the talks.

The plan also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. According to The New York Times, the document updates approximately every four years and is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear arms. The New York Times noted that it is expected to be reported to Congress before Biden leaves office after the November 5 elections. The change in strategy is attributed to the emerging association between Russia and China and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine. China's nuclear ambitions are also a factor, with its nuclear expansion advancing at a faster rate than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of Washington and Moscow's arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October last year that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous predictions, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The Department of Defense's annual report on Chinese military power, published at the request of Congress, estimated that China's arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its Army is 'basically complete' by then. The report also highlighted that China considers its 'limitless' association with Russia to be fundamental to advancing its development and emergence as a great power.", "title": "Joe Biden cambia en secreto la estrategia nuclear de EU: Pide prepararse para ataques de China y Rusia", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[EF](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2024/08/20/joe-biden-cambia-en-secreto-la-estrategia-nuclear-de-eu-pide-prepararse-para-ataques-de-china-y-rusia)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Investigative", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-history-that-cannot-be-repeated", "article_id": "80ceb304-119c-58f7-a04b-a2db3f684e3f", "classification": "Politics", "country": "US", "source_id": "The Good Men Project", "page_rank": 5385, "domain_url": "goodmenproject.com", "eng_title": "Hiroshima and Nagasaki: A Warning Against Nuclear Proliferation", "entities": {"Person": ["author"], "Organization": ["national governments"], "Location": ["North Korea", "Nagasaki", "Hiroshima"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["October 2, 2024", "January 5, 2025"], "Event": ["Third World March for Peace and Non-violence"], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["80,000", "75,000"], "Time": ["six months"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": ["79th"], "Arms": ["nuclear arsenals"], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": ["nuclear proliferation", "Science and Justice"]}, "image_url": "https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iStock-470309868.jpg", "keywords": ["Nuclear Proliferation", "Hiroshima", "Nagasaki", "Disarmament"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-08-20 22:30:49+00:00", "summary": "The article commemorates the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
