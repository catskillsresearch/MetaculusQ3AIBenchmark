Harris will participate in a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, while Trump will attend a event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing the US-Israeli Council. Winfrey, a Harris supporter, will host a two-hour live stream in Michigan, 'Unite for America', highlighting the dozens of grassroots groups supporting Harris. Trump will speak at a nighttime event, 'Fighting antisemitism in the US', alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks and widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Trump will also address the US-Israeli Council, a non-profit organization supported by Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, a prominent donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The Council is holding its national convention in the weeks leading up to the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. The 'Uncommitted' protest movement, which opposes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, has announced it will not support Harris but urged its supporters to vote against Trump. The group, which received hundreds of thousands of votes in the Democratic primaries this year, has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US arms shipments to Israel. 'Uncommitted' warned that some Democratic voters may stay home in November, particularly in states like Michigan. Harris' campaign team did not directly address the group's announcement, but stated that the candidate 'will continue to work towards ending the war in Gaza in a way that ensures Israel's security, the release of hostages, an end to suffering in Gaza, and the Palestinian people's right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination'.", "title": "Trump dice ser \"mejor amigo\" de jud\u00edos tras conocerse alegatos de que un aliado suyo es antisemita", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[LAN](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/agencias/trump-dice-ser-mejor-amigo-de-judios-tras-conocerse-alegatos-de-que-un-aliado-suyo-es-antisemita-nid20092024)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "entity_relation_graph": null, "as_string_key": "[1]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.albertleatribune.com/2024/09/with-tim-walz-on-the-democratic-ticket-minnesota-republicans-also-hop-on-national-wave", "article_id": "7af6efe2-2503-51f3-b980-f86e9b811832", "classification": "Politics", "country": "US", "source_id": "Albert Lea Tribune", "page_rank": 53679, "domain_url": "albertleatribune.com", "eng_title": "With Tim Walz on the Democratic ticket, Minnesota Republicans also hop on national wave", "entities": {"Person": ["George Floyd", "Tom Emmer", "Paul Gazelka", "Tim Walz", "Kamala Harris", "Gazelka", "Walz", "Pete Stauber"], "Organization": ["Republicans"], "Location": ["Minnesota"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["2026"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["VP", "governor", "Senate Majority Leader", "U.S. Rep.", "House Majority Whip"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": ["COVID-19"], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://img.apmcdn.org/2485d3cfee3aaf56957e3260fcd4338f36e0e7d9/uncropped/1e09f2-20240716-a-man-speaks-to-a-crowd-at-a-convention-600.jpg", "keywords": ["Tim Walz", "Kamala Harris", "Minnesota", "Tom Emmer", "Pete Stauber"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-09-19 22:05:15+00:00", "summary": "Since Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her running mate, Minnesota Republicans have been given a national platform to criticize his leadership.
