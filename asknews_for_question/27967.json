The change, primarily cosmetic, involved removing certain warning terms from Tesla, including a statement warning drivers that FSD 'might do the worst thing at the worst time' and reminding them to 'always keep their hands on the wheel.' Tesla must obtain regulatory approval from local authorities before it can start selling its packages. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, visited Beijing earlier this year as a company ready to register its software with the authorities. 'Very soon, we will ask for regulatory approval of Tesla's supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries,' Musk said during the company's second-quarter earnings call in July. 'And I think we're likely to get it before the end of the year, which will be an obvious driver of demand in those regions.' Musk wrote on X that right-hand drive markets should 'hopefully' get FSD later in the first quarter of 2025 or early in the second quarter, pending regulatory approval. The CEO made the growing adoption of FSD a key point of Tesla's long-term approach to fully autonomous vehicles and a fleet of autonomous robotaxis. To progress in the development of the software and convince regulators, Tesla must continue to collect data.
