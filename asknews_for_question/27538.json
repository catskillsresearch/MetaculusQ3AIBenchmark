The attack, which represents a major foreign incursion into Russia since World War II, has created a dilemma for Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to US President Joe Biden. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers crossed the Russian border in the early hours of August 6 in the Kursk region in western Russia, which Putin described as a major provocation aimed at gaining an advantage in future ceasefire negotiations. 'The situation remains difficult,' said Yuri Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger born in Ukraine. 'The enemy still has the initiative and, therefore, although slowly, is increasing its presence in the Kursk region.' Russia said on Wednesday that it had destroyed 117 Ukrainian drones in Russia during the night, mainly in the Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. It said missiles were also shot down and showed Sukhoi Su-34 bombers attacking Ukrainian positions in Kursk. According to unconfirmed reports, some of the Ukrainian drones hit Russian airbases. The Russian National Guard said it was reinforcing security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is just 35 km from the fighting. Russian commanders said the front in Kursk had stabilized, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces continued to advance in the area and ordered his generals to develop the next 'fundamental steps' in the operation. Biden said US authorities were in constant contact with Ukraine about the invasion of Russia, which, according to him, 'created a real dilemma' for Putin, who ordered the entry of thousands of soldiers into Ukraine in 2022. The White House said Ukraine did not warn in advance about its incursion and that the US had no involvement in the operation, although Russian authorities suggested that Western supporters of Ukraine must have known about the attack.", "title": "Ucr\u00e2nia ataca R\u00fassia com drones e diz que est\u00e1 avan\u00e7ando na regi\u00e3o da fronteira", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[UOL](https://www.bol.uol.com.br/noticias/2024/08/14/ucrania-ataca-russia-com-drones-e-diz-que-esta-avancando-na-regiao-da-fronteira.htm)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[10]"}], "news knowledge": [{"article_url": "https://azh.kz/ru/news/view/105418", "article_id": "5093d9a1-26dd-576a-a419-ee3186d3a64c", "classification": "Politics", "country": "KZ", "source_id": "\u0410\u049b \u0416\u0430\u0439\u044b\u049b", "page_rank": 309090, "domain_url": "azh.kz", "eng_title": "Lukashenko: Nuclear Strike on Ukraine Would Leave Putin Without Allies", "entities": {"Person": ["Vladimir Putin", "Alexander Lukashenko", "Putin", "Lukashenko"], "Organization": [], "Location": ["Kiev"], "Nationality": ["Belarusian", "Ukrainian", "Ukrainians", "Russian"], "Date": ["2022"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["President"], "Number": [], "Arms": ["nuclear weapons", "dirty bomb", "tactical nuclear weapons"], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://f.azh.kz/news/105/418/935266c335b112159.jpg", "keywords": ["Nuclear Strike", "Ukraine", "Putin", "Lukashenko"], "language": "ru", "pub_date": "2024-08-19 17:04:00+00:00", "summary": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would leave Russian President Vladimir Putin without allies.

He also noted that 'there is a high probability of an attack on both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants.' The Kharkiv Oblast police also reported on the nuclear provocation, stating, 'At the moment, it is known that the intention is to attack the atomic objects of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants in Kurchatov and Energodar.

The Russian Defense Ministry announced that a Su-34 fighter-bomber had launched a night attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in the Kursk region, using a 500kg bomb. The ministry also stated that a thermobaric missile had been used to strike a site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric weapons are nearly 100% combustible explosive, which sucks oxygen and are much more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian Emergency Ministry has reported that over 76,000 people have been evacuated from the border areas in the Kursk region, where fighting is ongoing between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the risk of a nuclear accident at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located near the conflict zone. The agency has called for maximum restraint in military activities near the plant to ensure its physical integrity. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that 219 civilians were killed in July, the highest number since October 2022. At least 71 children were killed or injured in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war. 'It's been 900 days since the escalation of the war in Ukraine, and every day we've seen a child killed or injured,' said Stephane Moissaing, national director of Save the Children in Ukraine. 'This year, the violence has intensified, and missiles, drones, and bombs have killed children day after day.

Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon.
