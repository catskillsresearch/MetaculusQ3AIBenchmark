The majority of these raids target refugee camps, which Israel considers to be strongholds of armed groups such as Jenin and Nur Shams. For example, on October 19, 2023, Israeli forces besieged Nur Shams, demolished its infrastructure, and killed 7 Palestinians. A week later, a deadly raid on Jenin and its refugee camp resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people.

The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the Israeli occupation's attack on the West Bank, warning of the 'escalating deadly and unjustified violence' by Israeli forces. The organization stated that 'Israel's coordinated large-scale military attack on cities and towns across the occupied West Bank comes after a surge in unlawful killings by its forces in recent months, and will put more Palestinians at risk.' Since October 2023, there has been a 'shocking increase' in the use of deadly force by Israeli forces and violent attacks by settlers, backed by the Israeli government, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the killing of at least 622 Palestinians, including 142 children. Amnesty International emphasized that the ongoing military operations on this scale will inevitably lead to an escalation of deadly violence, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. The organization also predicted that these operations will lead to an increase in forced displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, and collective punishment, which were the cornerstones of Israel's apartheid system against Palestinians and the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Amnesty International called on the Israeli occupation to take measures to protect healthcare facilities and workers, citing reports of Israeli forces besieging hospitals and preventing access to them.
