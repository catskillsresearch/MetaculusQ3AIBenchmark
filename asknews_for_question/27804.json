According to FSB data, Durov entered Russia more than 50 times during this period. Journalists verified the data by randomly selecting routes. In 2014, Durov stated that the FSB demanded that he reveal personal data of users who participated in the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. He also reported that the Kremlin insisted on removing Russian opposition groups from social media and that armed law enforcement officers visited his home. In April of the same year, Durov sold his stake in the social network 'Vkontakte' and left Russia, stating that 'there is no way back.' However, from 2015, Durov regularly visited Russia, especially between 2015 and 2017 and from 2020 to 2021. The only exception was the time when the Russian government tried to block Telegram. Durov did not hide his visits, flying between St. Petersburg and European cities on Aeroflot flights and traveling by train to Helsinki. The lack of information about some of his trips may be due to the fact that he entered Russia through Belarus, where there is no border control with Russia. According to the investigation, Durov first visited St. Petersburg in May 2015, and by the end of 2017, he had visited Moscow and St. Petersburg at least 41 times. His brother, Nikolai, also actively participated in the development of Telegram and visited Russia with him. On June 20, 2021, Pavel Durov again arrived in St. Petersburg, combining his life between Russia, the UAE, and Europe until the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. During this period, chatbots, including those related to the opposition team of Alexei Navalny, were blocked before the 2021 State Duma elections. On October 21, 2021, Durov left Russia, flying from Pulkovo Airport to the Spanish island of Ibiza, and has not returned since. However, according to FSB data, his personal assistant continues to regularly visit Russia, likely to prepare Durov's visits to the country.

The company stated that Telegram 'complies with EU laws' and that content moderation 'meets industry standards and is constantly improving.' The statement also claimed that Durov 'has nothing to hide' and that he 'continuously travels across Europe.' The team called the allegations that Durov or the platform are responsible for user abuses 'absurd' and expressed hope for a 'swift resolution' to the situation. French authorities have not commented on the arrest. Durov is being held as a suspect in a case of complicity in illegal activities, including narcotics trafficking, terrorism, child pornography, and other crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office stated that they will release a statement on August 26. The Russian Embassy in France has requested consular access to Durov. Durov has been living in France since 2014, after leaving Russia due to government pressure to shut down opposition groups on his platform, 'Vkontakte.' He has since acquired French citizenship and holds passports from several other countries. In 2022, Durov requested that Forbes no longer refer to him as a Russian businessman. In 2018, Russian authorities briefly blocked access to Telegram after the platform refused to provide the FSB with encryption keys, citing constitutional guarantees of privacy. A mass protest in support of Telegram was held in Moscow, with Alexei Navalny speaking at the event. The block was later lifted. Elon Musk has called for Durov's release, posting several messages on X, including a quote from Durov's interview with Takar Carlson.
