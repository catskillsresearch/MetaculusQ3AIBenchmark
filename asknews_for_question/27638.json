The company has informed its employees about the decision on August 27, 2024. The layoffs are part of Apple's fourth round of layoffs in 2024. The affected employees are from the Apple Books and Apple Bookstore teams. However, the company has also laid off some employees from other service departments, including News. Apple has stated that it will provide affected employees with 60 days to find a new position within the company. This move is seen as a continuation of the industry's trend of downsizing. Other tech giants like Google, Intel, and Amazon have also laid off thousands of employees in 2024, citing the slow-down of the US economy and the aftermath of the pandemic.

The letter, sent on August 15, 2024, is based on reports from The Wall Street Journal and the Tech Transparency Project. According to the reports, Meta was unable to prevent ads for prescription pills and cocaine from appearing on its platforms, directing users to websites where they could buy these substances. The lawmakers pointed out that in March 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal authorities were investigating Meta for allowing the sale of illicit drugs. However, in July 2024, the newspaper revealed that the situation had not improved, and the drug ads continued to be displayed. The lawmakers, including Tim Walberg, Gus Bilirakis, Kathy Castor, and Lori Trahan, are concerned that Meta continues to display these ads despite the ongoing federal investigation. They claim that the ads were not hidden and were easily found, containing clear references to illegal drugs. The lawmakers have also criticized Meta for not detecting these ads with its internal processes and have asked Zuckerberg to respond to a list of 15 questions about how the company is handling the issue. Meta confirmed receiving the letter and stated that it would respond shortly. In a statement, Meta said, 'Drug traffickers are criminals who operate on platforms and communities, and that's why we work with authorities to combat this activity. Our systems are designed to detect and act proactively against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads that violate our policies on drugs. We continue to invest resources and improve even more the application of this type of content.

Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.", "title": "Tech-K\u00fcndigungswelle verliert an Schwung", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[HE](https://www.heise.de/news/Tech-Kuendigungswelle-verliert-an-Schwung-9806278.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
