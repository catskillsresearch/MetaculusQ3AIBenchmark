In public transportation, people with disabilities of group I will no longer be allowed to ride without a ticket, unless accompanied by a caregiver.

Volodin also mentioned that the requirements for the founders of management companies will be significantly tightened, and individuals with unexpired convictions for certain crimes, including economic ones, will be barred from becoming founders.

The 'Registry of Military Accounting' will be launched, where information about conscripts will be stored. There is less than a month left before the fall draft. Lawyer Marat Samsonov explained the rules: 'The military commissariat can issue draft notices not only personally or through an employer, but also by registered mail and electronically. The document will be placed in the registry, and a notification will appear in the conscript's cabinet on the 'Gosuslugi' website. The document is considered delivered seven days after its placement in the electronic registry, regardless of whether the conscript saw the letter or not.' Draft notices sent by postal mail are considered delivered on the day of delivery, provided there is a notation from the postal service about delivery. Conscripts are required to appear at the military commissariat themselves to verify their data within two weeks of the start of the draft, unless they received a draft notice in the previous draft. This rule does not apply to those who: are under 18 years old; have reached the maximum age of 27 years by December 31, 2023, or 30 years by January 2024; have a deferment or exemption from military service. Deferment from conscription can be obtained by: citizens studying in technical schools, universities on bachelor's, specialist's, and master's programs; employees of IT companies from the state list who have submitted their applications in advance; those with two or more children; those who are the sole breadwinners in their families; and others, as established by law. What can happen if a conscript does not appear at the military commissariat? There is no criminal or administrative liability for not appearing at the military commissariat within two weeks of the start of the draft. However, not appearing at the military commissariat is associated with other risks: receiving a fine for failing to report changes in education or residence, receiving a 'draft dodger' certificate that can hinder further government service, and even being charged with a crime. After the launch of the military accounting registry, it will be impossible to hide from the military commissariat. As Marat Samsonov noted, there are several restrictions introduced to ensure attendance at the military commissariat. Citizens subject to conscription are prohibited from leaving Russia from the date of placement of their draft notice in the registry. Failure to appear without a valid reason within 20 days of receiving a draft notice will result in temporary measures, including restrictions on registering as an individual entrepreneur and self-employed, registering vehicles and driving, registering real estate, and obtaining loans and credits. However, these measures will not be applied until the registry is launched. If a conscript from Petrozavodsk, Karelia, needs legal assistance, they can contact us. We help conscripts: with consultations and assistance in obtaining deferments from the army, recognizing them as unfit for service, and appealing draft decisions. Our lawyers are professionals in the field of conscription and military law.

According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier.

The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered.

Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower.
