The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer after eight days of negotiations between the company's management and the local branch of the Machinists' Union. The new agreement would replace one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the Machinists' Union, who represents around 33,000 of the company's 170,000 employees at the coastal site in northwestern United States, the workers rejected the agreement announced on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said at a press conference on Thursday, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' He also announced a lawsuit against Boeing at the Federal Agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group was in 2008 and lasted 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes, which were originally delayed in delivery. Production also stopped at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, and a site for re-manufacturing dozens of 787 Dreamliner aircraft in Everett, which has been operational for several months. However, the production of Dreamliner aircraft is not currently affected as the factory is located in South Carolina (East) and is not included in the strike. Boeing receives the largest payments, around 60%, when the planes are delivered. The company is also subject to more oversight and its production has slowed down since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door while in flight in early January. According to the aviation news site 'Leeham News', 'The strike is the last thing Boeing needs, which is struggling financially.' Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the strike decision, the management announced in a statement, 'We are committed to restoring our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The new CEO, Kelly Orourke, promised after a week of taking office on August 8 to work on improving the relationship with the union. The rejected agreement includes a 25% increase in wages over four years, as well as a commitment to invest in the Seattle area, and also the construction of a new plane to be produced in 2035, which would provide job opportunities for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these concessions would be enough to avoid the strike, given its unstable financial situation due to the crash of two 737 Max 8 planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, as well as numerous quality control issues. Kelly Orourke, who replaced Dave Calhoun as CEO last month, said, 'It's no secret that our business is going through a difficult period, partly due to our past mistakes... The strike will hinder the group's and its employees' recovery.' He urged employees not to 'give up' on the expected progress in the future due to 'past disappointments.' However, the workers consider the proposed wage increase to be too low, and the proposed pension plan to be unacceptable. Cami Brian, who has worked at Boeing for 18 years, said to AFP after the vote in favor of the strike, 'We were sold cheap... We cannot accept these crumbs they offer us and be grateful.' She referred to the large salary of the company's president.

The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer group following negotiations that lasted since March 8 between the company's management and the local branch of the mechanics' union. The new agreement would replace the one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the mechanics' union in the region, who represents around 33,000 employees at the company's coastal facility in northwestern United States, out of 170,000 employees in the Boeing group, workers rejected the announced agreement on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said in a press conference, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' The union also filed a lawsuit against Boeing before a federal agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group dates back to 2008 and lasted for 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday morning led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes that have been delayed in delivery. Production also stopped at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, and a facility for re-manufacturing dozens of 787 Dreamliners in Everett, which has been operational for several months. However, Dreamliner assembly has not been affected as the factory is located in South Carolina and is not part of the strike. Boeing receives the largest payments, around 60%, when delivering the planes. The company is also subject to more scrutiny and its production has slowed down since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 that lost a door while in flight in early January. According to the 'Leeham News' website, which specializes in aviation news, 'the strike is the last thing Boeing needs, which is struggling financially.' Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. As of 14:00 GMT, Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the strike decision, the management announced in a statement, 'We are committed to restoring our relationships with our employees and the union, and we are ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The company's new president, Kelly Ortberg, promised to improve relations with the union after a week of taking office on August 8. The rejected agreement includes a 25% increase in wages over four years, as well as a commitment to invest in the Seattle area, and also the construction of a new plane expected to be produced in 2035, which would provide job opportunities for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these incentives would be enough to avoid the strike, while its financial situation is unstable due to the crash of two 737 Max 8 planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, as well as numerous quality production issues. In the evening of Wednesday, Kelly Ortberg said that 'it is no secret that our business is going through a difficult period, and this is partly due to our past mistakes... the strike will hinder the group's and its employees' recovery.' He urged employees not to 'give up' on the expected progress due to 'past disappointments.' However, workers consider the proposed wage increase too low, and the proposed pension plan unacceptable.
