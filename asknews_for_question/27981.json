According to NASA, the undocking is planned for no earlier than 18:04 Eastern European Time (19:04 Moscow Time) on Friday, September 6, 2024, weather permitting and subject to readiness for operation. The spacecraft will require approximately six hours after undocking to reach the landing zone in the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. If all goes as planned, the Starliner is expected to land on parachutes at 12:03 (13:03 Moscow Time) on Saturday, September 7. Rescue teams at the landing site will secure and prepare the spacecraft for its return to the Boeing Starliner factory at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. As a reminder, NASA announced on August 24 that the Starliner would return to Earth without a crew. The mission team had to update the Starliner's systems to enable a return in an unmanned mode. As a result, the Starliner will perform a fully autonomous return under the guidance of flight controllers at the Starliner Mission Control Center in Houston and the Boeing Mission Control Center in Florida. Ground teams can remotely control the spacecraft if necessary. The Boeing Starliner spacecraft was previously crewed by NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who launched to the station on the spacecraft in June 2024. Wilmore and Williams will remain on board the orbital complex until February 2025 and will return on the NASA Crew-9 mission.", "title": "NASA \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c: Boeing Starliner \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0432 7 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[XBT](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2024/08/30/nasa-boeing-starliner-7.html)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
