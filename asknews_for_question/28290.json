After accounting for expenses, Virgin Galactic expects to generate a net income of $95-110 million per year. The company also considers the possibility of adding a second spaceport, possibly in Europe or the Middle East, which would increase the number of flights to 275 per year, generating $990 million in revenue and a net income of $450-500 million per year. These financial models are based on several assumptions, including sufficient demand for high-priced space flights. Virgin Galactic's own research, as well as research by Credit Suisse and Jeffries Global Research, estimate a global addressable market of 300,000 people, growing at 8% annually. The company currently has around 700 customers. Virgin Galactic is just beginning the transition from designing spaceplanes to production, working with Bell Textron and Qarbon Aerospace to produce key sections of the vehicles. Final assembly will be done at a new factory in Mesa, Arizona. The company expects to receive the first components from its suppliers in the first half of 2025 and plans to roll out and test the first ship in the second half of the year. 'It will take several years before we start flights at the second spaceport,' said Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic, mentioning the development of the spaceport itself and necessary regulatory approvals.
