Behind the giant is Jeff Bezos, a well-known figure who embodies the American myth of the small entrepreneur who started from scratch and is now one of the richest men in the world. The story begins in a garage in Seattle, where Bezos created Amazon in 1994. He shared a video on his Instagram account showing his early technical installations, a computer and a photocopier. Bezos, a passionate reader and computer scientist, left his job on Wall Street to start Amazon, which initially focused on creating the world's largest bookstore. The company's growth was rapid, and in 1997, Amazon went public. Since then, Bezos has sold over $27 billion worth of Amazon shares, making him one of the richest people in the world. Today, he is the second richest person on the planet, with a fortune estimated by Forbes to be $210 billion. He has also invested in various companies, including Google, Uber, and Airbnb, and has developed new projects such as a streaming service and a space tourism company, Blue Origin.", "title": "Amazon a 30 ans, l'histoire d'un libraire devenu multimilliardaire", "sentiment": 1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[ME](https://www.mac4ever.com/divers/183347-amazon-a-30-ans-l-histoire-d-un-libraire-devenu-multimilliardaire)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Narrative", "as_string_key": "[4]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.cnews.fr/monde/2024-07-05/30-ans-damazon-voici-la-somme-gagnee-chaque-seconde-par-le-geant-du-e-commerce", "article_id": "a284de03-d3a1-51cd-8469-9d4a948ebb6c", "classification": "Business", "country": "FR", "source_id": "CNEWS", "page_rank": 13071, "domain_url": "cnews.fr", "eng_title": "Amazon's 30th Anniversary: A Look at the Company's Extraordinary Evolution", "entities": {"Person": ["Elon Musk", "Jeff Bezos"], "Organization": ["GAFAM", "Microsoft", "Facebook", "Apple", "Google", "Amazon"], "Location": ["world"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["1994", "2023"], "Event": [], "Money": ["$20 billion", "\u20ac590", "$214 billion", "$636"], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": ["Forbes"], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://static.cnews.fr/sites/default/files/john-mcarthur-roqzkiady78-unsplash_1_66858a5b25cac_0.jpg", "keywords": ["Amazon", "Jeff Bezos", "E-commerce", "GAFAM", "Forbes"], "language": "fr", "pub_date": "2024-07-05 04:51:41+00:00", "summary": "Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary, having been founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos.
