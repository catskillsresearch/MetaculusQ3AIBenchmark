This decrease in inflation rate has given impetus to the possibility of reducing interest rates by the Federal Reserve in September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 2.9% in annual terms, below the 3% reported in June, and the lowest level since March 2021. The CPI was slightly below the average of economists consulted by Dow Jones, Newswires, and The Wall Street Journal. However, prices increased by 0.2% in the monthly comparison with June, when they were 0.1%. This trend corresponds to the expectations of analysts, according to the MarketWatch consensus. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes volatile products such as food and energy, was 3.2% in annual terms, also in line with market expectations and a slight decline from the previous month (3.3%). US President Joe Biden celebrated the 'progress' in the fight against inflation. 'There is still work to be done to reduce costs for American workers, but we have made real progress, with wages increasing more rapidly than prices over the past 17 months,' he highlighted in a statement. The decrease in inflation is mainly due to the decline in prices of vehicles, new and used, and to a lesser extent, clothing and fuels. Services, excluding energy, the main drivers of inflation, increased in the monthly comparison: 0.3% in July compared to 0.1% in June. The largest increases were in housing and transportation. 'The housing data are a bit disappointing and continue to be a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve,' estimated Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, in a note. 'The high prices of housing seem persistent, but with a reduction in other sectors, the Fed has a green light to reduce rates by 25 points' in its next meeting, he said. In summary, the trend of increasing prices indicates that the long-term goal of 2% in annual terms set by the Federal Reserve could be achieved. 'We do not observe a sharp drop in prices, as would be expected in the case of an economic collapse,' highlighted the economists of HFE in a note. 'Who expects to see three rate cuts by the Fed will not find anything in these data that can confirm them.' The financial markets panicked on August 5 due to an unexpected increase in interest rates by the Bank of Japan and fears of a recession in the US economy, following the release of disappointing data. US economic activity shows clear signs of deceleration after almost two years of exceptional growth, but so far, there are no signs of a potential recession despite a slight increase in unemployment last month. So far, the institution has refused to reduce interest rates, considering that it still does not have data that demonstrates that this goal will be achievable and sustainable in the long term. The United States recorded a peak inflation rate of 9.5% in terms of homologous in June 2022, after the global economy reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve responded by increasing interest rates, which rose to a range between 5.25% and 5.50%, its highest level since the beginning of the century.

The July 2024 Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing survey showed a steep drop in the employment component to 43.4, the lowest level since June 2020. The decline in industrial production and manufacturing output, as well as the drop in consumer goods production, signal weak factory output. The Empire State and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys for August 2024 reinforced indications of a softening in activity, with declines in employment metrics.

Recent inflation data suggest progress in the Federal Reserve's disinflation efforts, with the June Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index and several months of core inflation prints roughly aligned with the Fed's 2 percent target. However, the combination of July's CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) data imply an acceleration in the core PCE deflator on both monthly and annual bases.

The S&P 500 plummeted over 6% between August 4 and 6 after the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July. Many analysts questioned the soft landing, but the data shows that the unemployment rate increased by 0.8 percentage points in a year, from 3.5% in July 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024. However, the Sham rule, which predicts a recession when the average unemployment rate over the last three months exceeds its 12-month minimum by 0.5 percentage points, is being followed. The average unemployment rate increase observed in the last three months is 0.53 percentage points. Although the indicator observed in July barely exceeds the rule, economist Michael Strain notes that 'when the unemployment rate goes up a little, it goes up a lot, which is why many believe the Fed should declare victory in its battle against inflation and start its cycle of rate cuts. However, this view is wrong, as it misreads the inflation perspective and the labor market.' The Fed is expected to wait for the July inflation rate, which is the key rate that follows, corresponding to the 12-month variation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding fuels and food, which had registered 2.6% in May and June, the lowest since March 2021. The two presidential candidates, Trump and Harris, have positioned themselves on the economic theme, with Trump prioritizing the fight against immigration and only in point 3, 'ending inflation and making the US affordable again.' Harris has presented her economic agenda, prioritizing building an 'opportunity economy' for the middle class, and has committed to stopping the price increases of products like food and combating price speculation.

Over the past 12 months, the CPI has risen by 2.9%, a slight decrease from the 3.0% annual increase recorded in June. Economists had predicted a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.0% annual increase. These data follow a report published on Tuesday indicating a slight increase in production prices for the month of July. The moderation of annual CPI growth from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 suggests that inflation is approaching the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The Fed must now make a decision on interest rates at its next meeting on September 17-18, with market expectations divided between a 0.5% rate cut and a 25 basis point reduction. This indecision is partly due to the fact that the unemployment rate has reached its highest level in three years, at 4.3%, in July. Despite the rise in unemployment, which has increased for four consecutive months, economists suggest that a significant deterioration in the labor market would be necessary for the central bank to consider a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut. They attribute the rise in unemployment primarily to an increase in labor supply due to immigration, rather than an increase in layoffs.

The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also increased by 0.2% in the seventh month of 2024, after registering 0.1% in June. Both results were in line with market expectations of a 0.2% increase. In the 12-month accumulation, the CPI in July rose 3%, the same growth recorded in June and in line with market projections.

The RBA's Governor Michele Bullock warned that the RBA is ready to raise rates to combat persistently high inflation. Despite this, the Australian interest rates market is skeptical about the RBA's rate hike, with a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut almost fully priced before year-end. Key economic indicators for the week ahead include the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) interest rate decision, and the Australian labour force report. In the US, headline inflation decreased by 0.1% month-on-month (MoM) in June, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 3.0% year-on-year (YoY). The core inflation rate for June increased by 0.1%, leading to an annual rate of 3.3%. For July, headline inflation is expected to rise by 0.2% MoM, with the annual rate holding steady at 3.0% YoY. Core inflation is also expected to increase by 0.2% MoM, with the annual core rate predicted to soften to 3.2% YoY. In China, retail sales underperformed in June, coming in at 2.0% versus the 3.3% expected. The big miss in retail sales continues to reflect sluggish domestic demand. Trade data and Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figures have been mixed, failing to provide assurances for a more sustained recovery just yet.
