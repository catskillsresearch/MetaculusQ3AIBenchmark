Critics warn that this could undermine Mexico's young democracy and damage its economic partnership with the United States. The reform, which has been approved by the lower house of Congress, would require judges to resign in the next three years and be replaced by elected officials. This could lead to judges being influenced by popular support and potentially being sympathetic to the ruling party, Morena. L\u00f3pez Obrador says elected judges will be more accountable to the population, but legal scholars and human-rights groups argue that the direct election of judges won't address the root of the problem: underfunding, inadequate training, and corruption.

The summons, scheduled for this Friday, is part of a series of legal actions that seek to investigate the accusations made by the presidential candidate, who claimed to have collected 83.5% of the electoral acts to demonstrate a supposed fraud in the presidential elections of July 28. These acts, published by the Plataforma Unitaria and qualified as 'false' by the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has led the Public Ministry to investigate the alleged commission of several crimes, including usurpation of functions, forgery of a public document, and association for delinquency. The Chavist Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, explained that, according to Venezuelan jurisprudence, it is allowed to summon a person up to three times before taking more severe measures. Given Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's refusal to attend the first two summonses, the Prosecutor's Office prepared the third and last summons, clearly stating that the absence could trigger his arrest. In this context, the Venezuelan diplomat could face not only the deprivation of his liberty, but also an irregular judicial process, as has happened with the political prisoners of the Chavist government. Additionally, the risk of flight pointed out by the Prosecutor's Office could be used to justify more stringent precautionary measures, complicating the situation of the opposition leader even further.

The detention was recorded in a video published by opposition leader Mar\u00eda Gabriela Hern\u00e1ndez, which shows officials discussing the capture order and one of them mentioning a date of July 8. This incident is part of a series of irregular situations against several members of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado's team. Hern\u00e1ndez condemned the situation, calling it a new attack on the opposition. In a post on X, she said: 'The campaign chief of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and president of the Un Nuevo Tiempo party in Monagas, \u00c1ngel Aristimu\u00f1o, was deprived of his liberty by Judge Erick Ferrer's order. Each repressive action by the regime digs it deeper into electoral defeat, which we Venezuelans have already inflicted upon them.' Additionally, Mar\u00eda Oropeza, coordinator of Vente Venezuela in Portuguesa, reported that Mary Rodr\u00edguez, the campaign director of the Capital Guanare parish, and Mayra Montilla were detained and their home was arbitrarily searched by Dgcim, PNB, state police, and GNB. The journalist, Mario Hurtado, who tried to cover the incident, was mistreated by officials and had his photo chip removed. Oropeza stated that this is how the regime acts during an election campaign, treating those who only want freedom as criminals.", "title": "Detuvieron a \u00c1ngel Aristimu\u00f1o, jefe de comando de campa\u00f1a de Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez en Monagas", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[VAF](https://www.venezuelaawareness.com/2024/07/detuvieron-a-angel-aristimuno-jefe-de-comando-de-campana-de-edmundo-gonzalez-en-monagas)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[8]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.el-carabobeno.com/hija-de-edmundo-gonzalez-pago-prision-falso", "article_id": "5cc386c8-300d-5b32-8ece-17e4c83d20bb", "classification": "Politics", "country": "VE", "source_id": "El Carabobe\u00f1o", "page_rank": 177677, "domain_url": "el-carabobeno.com", "eng_title": "False Claim: Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's Daughter Did Not Commit Crimes", "entities": {"Person": ["\u00c9rika Carolina Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia", "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia", "Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez", "Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia"], "Organization": ["El Carabobe\u00f1o DetECta"], "Location": [], "Nationality": [], "Date": [], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": ["intentional personal injuries", "corruption", "illegal deprivation of liberty"], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["presidential candidate"], "Number": ["ID number"], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.el-carabobeno.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/post-hija-de-edmundo-gonzalez-pago-prision-falso.jpg?fit=1187%2C779&ssl=1", "keywords": ["Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia", "False Claim", "El Carabobe\u00f1o DetECta"], "language": "es", "pub_date": "2024-07-12 22:52:28+00:00", "summary": "A viral document claims that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's daughter was imprisoned for committing several crimes, including illegal deprivation of liberty, intentional personal injuries, and corruption.
