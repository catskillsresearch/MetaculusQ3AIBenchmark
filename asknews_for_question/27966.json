The SEC recognizes that companies may not be able to determine materiality that quickly and notes that if there's not an unreasonable delay in reporting, there may be some leeway. Materiality is defined as any event that a reasonable person would consider important when making an investment decision, including operational, reputational, legal, and customer impact. Companies must submit a 10-K report every year to the SEC, while they file an 8-K form only after an incident has occurred. Both reports should err on the side of including more detail to fulfill requirements instead of withholding information. The SEC mandates that companies report each significant breach to assist investors in identifying potential pitfalls. If an incident occurs and is unreported but is later determined to be'material,' the four-day reporting clock begins then. The initial report provides an outline of the incident, and follow-up information will be filed, including incident response, resolution, impacts, etc. Incidents are reported in EDGAR, the SEC's electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system, regardless of resolution progress.
