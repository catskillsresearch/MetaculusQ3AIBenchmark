The WHO is stressing that we know more about this virus and how it spreads than we did about COVID-19. Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus. The virus can be spread through human-to-human contact, respiratory droplets, fomites, and animal-to-human transmission. The epidemiology of mpox has shifted since the outbreak in May 2022, with a marked increase in cases reported among men who have sex with men. The clinical presentation of mpox includes symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and characteristic skin lesions. People with mpox can only transmit the disease when they are showing symptoms. The WHO's designation of mpox as a public health emergency underscores the urgency of addressing the disease's potential for rapid spread, particularly in populations with low immunity due to the end of smallpox vaccination programs. The recent emergence of the more virulent clade 1 strain of mpox raises significant concerns about its potential to escalate into a global pandemic, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Current treatment options include vaccination strategies, which differ between the two primary clades of mpox, and antiviral treatments such as tecovirimat, which have been found to be ineffective.

Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low.

Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner.

These actions include: strengthening and deploying specific risk communication strategies, advancing coordination with the Pan American Health Organization to ensure vaccine availability, intensifying public health surveillance for diseases that cause visible skin lesions, and strengthening capacities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The National Institute of Health will continue and reinforce laboratory and genomic surveillance of Mpox. Additionally, the ministry is alerting health institutions, insurance companies, and territorial health entities to increase promotion, prevention, and early detection of the disease. It is worth noting that, according to health authorities, no cases of the Monkey Pox type (clade I) have been identified in Colombia, which affects Africa. However, Colombia has reported 4,257 confirmed cases of Mpox (clade II) with a peak of cases during the ESPII declaration in 2022, and 109 confirmed cases in 2024, with 2 active cases and no reported deaths. The Ministry of Health, the National University of Colombia, and the Government of Japan have been working since 2022 on the study of the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the Japanese vaccine against Mpox.
