This move comes after users began to cancel their contracts with providers, mistakenly blaming them for the issues with YouTube access. At least 135 Russian operators have seen a decline in customers. Experts believe that operators will not face punishment for this move, as Roskomnadzor has not announced any plans to slow down the service or add it to the list of banned social media platforms. Russian users have been experiencing issues with YouTube since August, with videos loading slowly or not loading at all without VPN services. In July, Rostelecom warned that YouTube may start to malfunction due to the wear and tear of Google servers in Russia. Google denied any involvement in the issues. In July, a State Duma deputy from United Russia, Alexander Khinstein, predicted a 70% slowdown of YouTube due to its 'anti-Russian policy'. He stated that this measure would initially affect only desktop versions. Meduza learned from a source in the telecommunications market that Russian authorities have decided to slow down YouTube to 128 kbps. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, YouTube blocked many pro-Kremlin channels. On the other hand, opposition media continue to operate on the platform.

The 'Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) organization has condemned this move, stating that it threatens the right to information. According to RSF, 'The Kremlin is on its way to achieving its dirty goal - locking Russian citizens in an information prison where only propaganda can freely circulate.' The organization has called for the Russian government to restore normal video playback speed on the platform. Users in occupied Ukrainian regions, as well as in Moscow and St. Petersburg, have reported difficulties accessing YouTube due to the slowed-down video playback speed. The Russian government has been gradually blocking YouTube, reducing the video playback speed to 128 kbps, which is significantly lower than the required level for optimal playback. This move is being implemented using 'technical means of countering threats' (TMT), also known as 'black boxes,' which are being installed in telecommunications operators in Russia since 2020 and are controlled by Roskomnadzor, the Russian telecommunications regulator. YouTube has been under scrutiny in Russia for several months, with Roskomnadzor accusing it of spreading disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government has warned that it will take direct action against the platform. According to a source close to the Russian administration, YouTube may be completely blocked by the fall, with the service's performance gradually deteriorating this summer. Independent media and journalists, forced to live in exile, have developed their own video formats on YouTube to circumvent the censorship imposed by the Kremlin, which is tightening its control over the internet. The success of YouTube is evident in the data from a report by The Fix and JX Fund, a journalism support fund created by RSF, which shows that in September 2023, videos from independent journalists and media reached 165 million views on the platform. One of the reasons for this popularity is that YouTube, unlike Facebook and Instagram, has not been banned by the Russian authorities. A protest rally planned by users in Moscow on August 17 to protest the slowdown of YouTube was banned by the authorities.

Last week, State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications Chairman Alexander Khinshtein announced that YouTube would be slowed down in Russia due to the platform's inability to pay the service fees for Russian data centers. Google later commented on the situation, stating that it would continue to operate in Russia, but did not provide further details.

The Russian Federal Censorship Agency, Roskomnadzor, has accused YouTube of numerous violations of Russian law and disrespect towards Russia and its citizens. Experts believe that this is a step towards controlling the online activities of Russians and creating a culture of self-censorship. The head of the State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, has stated that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers ceasing cooperation with Google. Meanwhile, the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom has attributed the slow loading of YouTube to a lack of Russian servers. The opposition publication Verstka has reported that Russia aims to replace YouTube with VK by loading all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. This move is seen as a step towards creating a controlled online environment. The Russian government has also expanded its legislation to cover not only everyday life but also the internet, with the aim of protecting government officials and military personnel from 'discreditation'.

He said, 'No one will ban our songs.' The Russian government has banned most gatherings in the capital, except for those organized by the Kremlin to criticize the West. In Russia, people who participate in banned gatherings face severe penalties.

His channel was blocked on YouTube in early July. On Tuesday, Russia requested that Google lift the ban on over 200 Russian channels on YouTube, citing 'propaganda' by the Kremlin. The Russian government has also tightened its control over the internet since the start of its attack on Ukraine, blocking several websites where critics of the Kremlin can express themselves freely, such as Facebook and Instagram.
