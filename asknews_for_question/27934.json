The economy, valued at 19,000 billion dollars, is facing a series of challenges, including a trade war, a prolonged housing crisis, and cautious consumer confidence, which have led to a slowdown in hiring. The job market has become increasingly competitive for young Chinese, with approximately 12 million students graduating this summer. Even rural job postings are being sought after by young graduates from top universities, highlighting the severity of the employment situation. The youth unemployment rate was previously at a record high of 21.3% in June last year, but the data was suspended due to concerns about including students still in school. The July unemployment rate is the highest since December 2023, following a change in methodology used to calculate the statistics. For those aged 25-29, the unemployment rate was 6.5% in July, while it was 3.9% for those aged 30-59, excluding students. A recent survey of factory managers showed that the manufacturing sector remains reluctant to hire new workers, with the employment gauge in this sector not having improved since February 2023. However, the services sector has provided some hope, with employment increasing in July at the fastest pace in 11 months, according to the Caixin/S&P Global survey of service sector purchasing managers. This increase may bring some optimism to policymakers concerned about the potential economic and social impact of high youth unemployment rates.", "title": "Le ch\u00f4mage des jeunes en Chine atteint 17,1 % en juillet Par Investing.com", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[I](https://fr.investing.com/news/economy-news/le-chomage-des-jeunes-en-chine-atteint-171--en-juillet-93CH-2528602)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
