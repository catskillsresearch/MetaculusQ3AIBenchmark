The WHO has expressed concern about the potential for Mpox to spread globally, but notes that the risk to Brazil is currently low. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has stated that it is updating its recommendations and contingency plan for the disease, but has not provided further details. Experts suggest that vaccination, particularly for those who have had close contact with infected individuals, is crucial to prevent outbreaks like the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two vaccines are recommended by the WHO, but neither is being used on a large scale in Brazil. A mass vaccination campaign is unlikely, unless there is a significant global health emergency.

The mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but also transmits through close physical contact with an infected person. 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent,' said Africa CDC President Jean Kaseya in a press conference. 'We declare mpox a continental public health emergency,' he added. This announcement, which will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurs before the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of alert internationally for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. There was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. The United States stated on Tuesday that it maintains 'close coordination' with the DRC, other affected countries, and health organizations. 'We are closely monitoring the spread of mpox in Central Africa. We are pleased to see international leadership in this region,' said Vedant Patel, spokesperson for the Department of State. The continent is facing the spread of a new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and called 'Clade Ib', which is more deadly and transmissible than previous ones. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, while previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of a clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly transmitted through contact with animals.

'If, in 2022, with a less severe strain, this category was declared, I would say that, given what is happening in African countries since 2023 with the clade1b, a more severe strain, the signs are that this will happen again,' argues the specialist. The new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023, 'is more associated with animal-to-human transmission,' says Correia. Infections have increased by 160% in 2024. The investigator notes that, 'in addition to causing potentially more severe disease,' the variant clade1b 'deserves attention, especially in contexts where access to healthcare cannot be immediate and health resources are not significant.' 'This also leads me to believe that it may be classified as a public health emergency by the WHO,' he adds. Correia acknowledges that a decision of this magnitude is highly influenced by geopolitics. 'Once the concern is in Africa and does not affect critical points internationally, it is possible that there will be entities and experts who do not consider that there is a public health emergency,' he recalls. The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) has already declared a 'continental public health emergency' due to the mpox outbreak. According to data released by CDC Africa last week, since January 2022, there have been 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths in 16 African countries. In 2024, there was a 160% increase in infections compared to the previous year. The epidemic is putting pressure on the already fragile healthcare system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 90% of the cases have been reported. The country has registered 14,479 suspected and confirmed cases, and 455 deaths, as of August 3, according to the African Union's health agency, cited by Lusa. 'I would be surprised if it were not considered a public health emergency, given the pressure it is causing on African public health systems,' analyzes Correia. The specialist emphasizes that, currently, the risk of contagion of the disease in Portugal 'is extremely low,' but highlights the need for Portuguese and other Europeans to be aware of the evolution of the epidemiological situation in Africa, 'showing solidarity with the affected countries and being aware of the resources they need to control the epidemic, whether means of diagnosis and treatment or epidemiological surveillance.' 'Besides helping these countries, this prevents a chain reaction of the disease in others,' he sustains. Unlike previous strains, which caused localized skin lesions and mouth, face or genital organ problems, the clade 1b causes these types of skin problems throughout the body. Other symptoms may include fever, severe headaches and fatigue, according to Lusa. Some children may also experience respiratory problems and difficulty swallowing, making them more vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections and, in severe cases, the disease can cause sepsis. 'I would be surprised if it were not considered a public health emergency, given the pressure it is causing on African public health systems,' analyzes Correia.
