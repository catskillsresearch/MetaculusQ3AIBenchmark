This implies that the rally in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks may be slowing down as investors await a widely expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month. The index has risen by over 17% so far in 2024, driven by gains in Nvidia, Microsoft, and other heavyweight tech stocks. However, the market has become increasingly volatile in recent weeks due to concerns about a recession and the unwinding of leveraged positions on the market. 'The euphoria around AI is fading, and the market is facing a possible slowdown in GDP,' said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. 'The market is also facing a 'thin margin for error' due to stretched valuations.' The S&P 500 has fallen by 0.2% on Tuesday ahead of the annual central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which could provide clues on the trajectory of interest rate cuts. The index is down around 1% from its record high on July 16. Nvidia's stock has surged by 158% in 2024, and analysts expect its quarterly net income to more than double when it reports earnings next week, according to LSEG. The S&P 500 is expected to reach 5,900 points by the end of next year, representing a 5.2% gain from its current close, according to the poll. Market strategists have difficulty predicting the market's evolution, but their forecasts often correctly predict the direction of transactions. The uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election and the Middle East tensions, as well as the uncertainty about the number of interest rate cuts the Fed will make, make it particularly difficult to establish predictions for the stock market, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. 'More than half of the respondents said that a market correction of at least 10% was likely by the end of September. More than half of them predicted that corporate profits would exceed expectations until the end of 2024.'

Buffett has also sold a large portion of his stake in Apple, citing high valuations across the pond. He stated, 'Things aren't attractive.'

Firstly, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) potential rate cut could make borrowing cheaper, increasing interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. According to Jerome Powell, the Fed could change course earlier than expected, as he said, 'If you wait for inflation to come down to 2%, you've probably waited too long because the tightening you're doing, or the level of tightening you have, will likely lead to inflation below 2%.' The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 18, and a rate cut would be a positive sign for Bitcoin. Secondly, the outcome of the US presidential election could also impact Bitcoin's price. Donald Trump's potential victory could be seen as a positive for Bitcoin, as he has been pro-crypto and has promised to promote the sector. Trump has also expressed his desire to make the US a leader in cryptocurrencies and establish a national strategic reserve of Bitcoin. Finally, the halving event, which occurs every four years and reduces the daily emission of new Bitcoins, has historically been a precursor to a major rally in Bitcoin's price. According to some experts, Bitcoin tends to enter a parabolic phase around 160 days after the halving event, which could happen in September. Additionally, the fear and greed index, which measures investor sentiment, has been in 'extreme fear' territory, which some investors see as a buying opportunity.

He has sold 90 million shares of Bank of America, worth $3.8 billion, between mid-July and early August. This is the first time he has sold Bank of America shares in a long time. Some experts believe that the sale is not due to higher expected taxes on capital gains, but rather a trend change in the banking sector. A first interest rate cut in September 2024 is likely, which would be negative for the most interest-rate sensitive US bank. Additionally, the US economy is starting to weaken, which would add headwinds for a large bank like Bank of America. Higher provisions for loan defaults and decreased loan demand are also expected. Furthermore, the bank may not be undervalued anymore, with a price-to-book ratio above 1 and a low price-to-earnings ratio of around 12. 'I would not call this a throw-in-the-towel moment,' said Frank Seehawer, 'it's a big bet on the US economy, which every investor, according to Warren Buffett, would lose.' The portfolio still consists of Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum, with a mix of technology, banking, consumer goods, and energy.

Interpretation of the indicator values: Over 100%: If the value of the indicator exceeds 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is overvalued, with stock prices being high relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential correction or decline in the market. Less than 100%: If the value of the indicator is below 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is undervalued, with stock prices being low relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential investment opportunities. Buffett uses this indicator as a general indicator to determine whether it is worth investing in the stock market at this time or waiting for more favorable conditions. Although the Buffett indicator is a useful tool, it is important to remember that it is only one of many indicators used to evaluate the state of the market and does not guarantee accurate predictions. The concern is that the indicator has been trending towards a sharp increase before almost every recession the US has experienced - big or small. Although the ratio of market capitalization to GDP has not yet reached a record high - it was around 217% in 2020 - but it is already significantly higher than the level seen before the dot-com bubble burst and the start of the Great Recession in 2007. Is a stock market crash inevitable? Although the Buffett indicator is not a guaranteed predictor of a crash, its value should make investors think. For now, it significantly exceeds the range considered a sign of a properly valued stock market - a ratio to 100%. On the other hand, comparing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies to GDP is not the only indicator suggesting the existence of a 'bubble'. In February, one of the alarming parallels between 2024 and 1929 was the growth of concentration of profits - a concentration where the top 10 largest companies account for 77% of the S&P 500. Finally, many well-known analysts and experts - including those who precisely predicted previous crises - have said that the technology sector has become a large 'bubble'. However, there are certain discrepancies regarding whether this bubble will burst, and many still consider the boom to be stable.", "title": "'\u0406\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440' \u0412\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0454 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0443 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0442\u0442\u044f", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[PSM](https://psm7.com/uk/investicii/indikator-vorrena-baffeta-poperedzhaye-pro-najbilshu-bulbashku-za-stolittya.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
