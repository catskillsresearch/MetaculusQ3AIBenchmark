The election will determine the composition of the Landtag, which will then elect the Minister-President. The current government, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD), has been in power for five years. To be eligible to vote, one must be at least 18 years old and have lived in Brandenburg for at least three months. Voters can choose between two candidates in each of the 44 electoral districts, and the party with the most votes in each district will receive a direct mandate. The remaining 44 seats will be allocated based on the proportional representation of the parties' votes. If a party receives more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the proportional representation of the second votes, it will retain these 'overhang mandates.' The other parties will receive 'balance mandates' to ensure a proportional distribution of seats. A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes to be represented in the Landtag. The current leading candidates are Dietmar Woidke (SPD), Jan Redmann (CDU), and Benjamin Raschke (B\u00fcndnis 90/ Die Gr\u00fcnen). Robert Crumbach, the BSW leader, has stated that his party will not be a 'cheap majority provider' and will only participate in a government if they have a significant role. The election outcome is uncertain, with the AfD potentially becoming the strongest party. The current government, a coalition of SPD, CDU, and Gr\u00fcne, may struggle to maintain power. Possible coalition options include a coalition between SPD, CDU, and BSW, or a coalition between SPD and Gr\u00fcne.

In the upcoming election on September 22, a coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD is considered the most likely solution. However, this coalition does not have a majority and relies on at least one vote from the Left. Liedtke sees no ability to act with a strong AfD. She hopes that voters will make a decision to secure the state's ability to act, saying, 'As citizens of our country, you can now think about who or what you want to vote for to secure this ability to act.' Liedtke criticizes the AfD's goals, saying, 'Remigration is not acceptable to me.' She advocates for finding solutions for better integration of newcomers, such as job creation. The Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz has classified the AfD's state association as a right-wing extremist suspicion. The AfD plans to start a massive deportation program and dissolve the Verfassungsschutz in its current form after the election.

A study by the Bertelsmann-Stiftung suggests that the AfD could potentially gain more than a third of the seats in the Landtag with an assumed result of over a quarter of the second votes. This could lead to the AfD being able to block decisions that require a two-thirds majority, such as constitutional changes. Liedtke does not share these concerns, saying, 'I see it optimistically.' However, she also thinks that the electoral law needs to be revised, saying, 'We need to take the electoral law and probably shape it similarly to the federal level.' She also asks, 'How big should the parliament be?'
