The market had rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve suggested that interest rate cuts may be imminent, but on Friday, investors valued the possibility of a 'hard landing' in the economy due to high interest rates. According to Bret Kenwell, eToro's investment analyst, 'investors assume at least one rate cut in September', but after the weak employment report, 'the situation shifts from 'will the Fed cut rates' to 'how much will they cut'.' Joaqu\u00edn Robles, market analyst, noted that a 'correction between 5% and 15% should not be a major concern for investors, as many will be motivated to take profits after recent gains and the fear of economic cooling.' The Vix index, known as the 'fear gauge', surged 45% in this session, after rising 12% on Thursday.", "title": "Wall Street cae un 2 % a media sesi\u00f3n, arrastrado por Intel y los temores de recesi\u00f3n", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[EST](https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/2024/wall-street-cae-un-2-a-media-sesion-arrastrado-por-intel-y-los-temores-de-recesion.html)", "provocative": "medium", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
