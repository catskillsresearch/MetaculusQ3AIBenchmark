The airstrikes were in response to the killing of a high-ranking Hezbollah official, Fouad Chokr, and were intended to demonstrate Israel's ability to strike deep into Lebanese territory. However, Hezbollah has stated that the operation was only a response to the killing of its official and did not engage in any further action. The situation is volatile, with the risk of a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as a potential response from Iran to the killing of its ally, Isma\u00efl Haniyeh. The US has reinforced its military presence in the region in anticipation of a potential attack by Iran or its allies. However, it is unclear whether the US would engage in a war with Iran if Israel were to attack. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the US has no clear strategy for the region, and its approach has been reactive rather than proactive. The article also discusses the role of the US in the conflict, and how its support for Israel may be conditional on Israel's actions. The article concludes that the situation is precarious, and that a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as a potential response from Iran, could have devastating consequences for the region.

Firstly, the party wants to maintain its current deterrent power linked to the civilians, as it believes that a significant damage to the Lebanese environment would harm the war's objectives. Hezbollah has been able to accumulate military achievements that increase its ability to deter Israel without causing significant damage to Lebanon. Secondly, the party thinks that it is rapidly accumulating a technological and military superiority over Israel and can develop itself faster than Israel. Therefore, if a full-scale war is inevitable, it would be better to have it after a certain period when conditions would be more favorable. The party did not choose the current battle timing but rather that of Hamas, and despite starting the military confrontation with Israel from southern Lebanon, it finds that the international conditions are not suitable for defeating Israel. As a result, the war should be fought at a suitable international time with favorable conditions and historical circumstances. There is a theory within the party that suggests that the war with Israel may not be necessary, as the internal and external conditions will lead to a significant decline and weakness in Israel in the near future. The current tactical progress of Israel does not correspond to any strategic victory indicators, but rather the opposite, as Israel is suffering from a decline in its international image and major crises about how to manage the post-war phase and other issues that have been exposed since October 7. Therefore, the path to victory in the end is guaranteed for Hezbollah, at least according to the current vision, and within the effort and cost invested, which means that there is no need for any development in the battle. A new development has emerged, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed his red line, and Hezbollah is no longer the only one who has revealed its red line. It has become clear that all the hype and playing on the edge of the abyss regarding Israel and Netanyahu is not based on a genuine desire to go to a full-scale war with Lebanon.

Iran's strategy involves arming its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebels, with sophisticated weapons and encouraging sporadic low-level attacks to divert Israeli attention and resources away from the nuclear threat. Despite Israel's efforts to interdict Iranian munitions and halt the nuclear project, Iran's strategy has ultimately succeeded. Today, Hezbollah reportedly has 150-200,000 rockets of varying capabilities, and the various other Iranian proxies between Yemen and Iraq all have serious rocket and drone capabilities. The use of proxies allows Tehran a degree of plausible deniability and makes it less likely that Israel will retaliate directly against Iran itself. The situation escalated in October 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, and Hezbollah joined in, rocketing Israeli military targets from across the Lebanon-Israel border. The conflict has continued, with the Houthi rebels in Yemen also joining the fray, rocketing maritime traffic and paralysing Israel's southern port. The situation has gradually transformed into something approaching open Israeli-Iranian conflict, and the threat of an all-out, full-scale war is now palpable. On 13 April 2024, the Iranians launched a mixture of 350 cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic rockets at Israel, but Israeli anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences shot down almost all the projectiles.
