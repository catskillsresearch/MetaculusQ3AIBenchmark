'We have the capacity to influence Israel, of course we do', Borrell said, 'but what we lack is the will to influence'. He pointed out that in the past, Washington has acted to stop military aid and financial support to Israel, citing the 1982 Lebanon War and the pressure on Israeli authorities to attend the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991. Borrell noted that many of Israel's commercial exports go to the EU, and that the bloc has a policy of visa liberalization for Israeli citizens and supplies arms to Israel, just like the United States. According to Borrell, 'everyone reacts to effective pressure', and he lamented the lack of action from the US and EU, which have only denounced the high number of deaths. 'There will be a few more too many dead soon', he said. 'Do they want to use their influence or not? It seems they don't. There comes a time when diplomatic pressure is not enough and the phrase 'there are too many dead' becomes a phrase that alleviates your conscience but doesn't change anything', he added. Borrell also expressed skepticism about the progress of negotiations for a ceasefire. 'Every day without a ceasefire means more too many dead', he said. These comments come after Borrell confirmed that he will put on the table of EU member states the option of approving sanctions against members of the Israeli government for their support of radical settler attacks on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, following the latest attack in the town of Jit that left one dead. The sanctions will be discussed at the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers next week in Brussels, with a focus on the Israeli Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, who have clashed with EU diplomacy over their 'incendiary' statements against the Palestinian population.", "title": "Borrell critica falta de voluntad de la UE y EEUU para pararle los pies a Israel en Gaza Infobae", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[L](https://lado.mx/noticia.php?id=16529820)", "provocative": "high", "reporting_voice": "Investigative", "as_string_key": "[1]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/fitiller-ateslendi-H1538701.htm", "article_id": "cd6a20f3-9b79-535e-8aac-02a3b8a4f030", "classification": "Politics", "country": "TR", "source_id": "Yeni Mesaj", "page_rank": 359011, "domain_url": "yenimesaj.com.tr", "eng_title": "The Flames of War in the Region: A Threat to Turkey", "entities": {"Person": ["Fuad \u015e\u00fckr", "el-Husi", "Kenani", "\u0130smail Haniye"], "Organization": ["Hezbollah", "NATO", "Yemeni Ansarullah Movement"], "Location": ["Gaza", "Beirut"], "Nationality": ["Western"], "Date": [], "Event": ["dan\u0131\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 d\u00f6v\u00fc\u015f"], "Money": [], "Law": ["international law"], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["Foreign Minister"], "Number": [], "Arms": ["nuclear-capable submarine"], "Product": [], "Media": ["media"], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/resimler/yazarlar/faruk-ozekinci.jpg", "keywords": ["Israel", "Iran", "Turkey", "Gaza", "Hezbollah", "US"], "language": "tr", "pub_date": "2024-08-23 00:00:00+00:00", "summary": "The world is waiting for Iran and Hezbollah's response to Israel's assassination of Fuad \u015e\u00fckr and \u0130smail Haniye in Beirut and Tehran. Meanwhile, in Gaza, a series of inhumane actions have taken place over the past week. Despite the importance of analyzing the events and the background, the media is filled with claims that Iran and Israel are engaging in a 'dan\u0131\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 d\u00f6v\u00fc\u015f' (a staged fight). In reality, the US and its Western allies have always used two methods in the region: bribery and threats. They bribe officials, media, and businesspeople in countries that are on their side, and threaten those who are not. The US has sent a massive naval fleet, including a nuclear-capable submarine, to the region. The US, along with NATO's five core countries (US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy), issued a joint statement warning Iran not to escalate tensions in the region and promising to defend Israel if it is attacked. However, this was not a warning, but a threat that disregards international law and the sovereignty of nations. Iran's Foreign Minister Kenani responded to this threat by stating that Iran will defend itself without seeking permission from anyone. The leader of the Yemeni Ansarullah Movement, el-Husi, said that the US's attempt to prevent the resistance's response has failed and that the US's massive military presence in the region will not deter the resistance's determination to fight against Israel. The US is also trying to revive the ceasefire talks in Qatar. However, the resistance has stated that it will only stop its operations if the war in Gaza is stopped. Iran and Hezbollah have stated that they will respond to the assassination of Fuad \u015e\u00fckr and \u0130smail Haniye, but not to the war in Gaza. The US is following the Doha talks closely, with CIA Director William Burns and diplomat Brett McGurk attending the talks. However, Hamas has not taken the talks seriously, with its Political Bureau member Usame Hamdan stating that Hamas will only participate in the talks if the Biden plan is implemented. The leader of the Gaza resistance, Yahya Sinvar, has refused to participate in the talks, stating that Netanyahu does not want the war to end. The talks have been unsuccessful so far, and the next round is scheduled for this week. In Turkey, President Erdo\u011fan has stated that Turkey will take the same steps as it did in Karabakh and Libya if necessary. Israeli Foreign Minister Katz has responded by threatening Erdo\u011fan, saying that he is following in the footsteps of Saddam Hussein. Azeri media has praised the Azeri army and people for their victory in Karabakh, and stated that the military aid sent by Turkey was not a help, but a payment for the aid. Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party is on a tour of Palestine, visiting sites such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Israeli aim is to capture the Arz-\u0131 Mev'ud. The current conflict is not a Hamas-Israel war, but a larger conflict that involves the entire region. Turkey should be aware that the flames of war in the region will eventually reach its doorstep.

Israel will not accept the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Philadelphia Corridor, confirming that this was the real sticking point in the Gaza negotiations, not the prisoner exchange. Hamas had demanded the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphia Corridor, as a condition for reaching an agreement with Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza. Yesterday evening, Netanyahu's office denied previous media reports, stating in a statement: 'Israel will insist on achieving all its war objectives, as defined by the security cabinet, including ensuring that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel's security. This requires securing the southern border.' A source had reported to the US news portal Axios that President Biden had had a phone call with Netanyahu to encourage him to show more flexibility in order to reach an agreement for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza. According to Axios, the conversation focused on Netanyahu's new request that Israeli forces remain deployed along the Philadelphia Corridor. Israeli negotiators and US officials have stated that this new request represents a significant obstacle to a possible agreement.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the G7 that an attack by Tehran and Hezbollah on Israel could happen in the next 24 hours. According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.", "title": "Il pressing internazionale per evitare la guerra totale", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[G](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/pressing-internazionale-evitare-guerra-totale-2355821.html)", "provocative": "high", "reporting_voice": "Investigative", "as_string_key": "[7]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.lexpress.fr/monde/manoeuvres-diplomatiques-pour-eviter-une-escalade-militaire-au-moyen-orient-IJUMRBSWGZHKFM237GR2YT5PFU", "article_id": "b14017de-87d8-53c1-b39b-2ccaf82f44da", "classification": "Politics", "country": "FR", "source_id": "L'Express", "page_rank": 2746, "domain_url": "lexpress.fr", "eng_title": "Diplomatic Maneuvers to Avoid Military Escalation in the Middle East", "entities": {"Person": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Isma\u00efl Haniyeh", "Hassan Nasrallah", "Volker T\u00fcrk", "Netanyahu", "Ali Khamenei"], "Organization": ["Air France", "Transavia", "Lufthansa", "Hamas", "Hezbollah", "UN"], "Location": ["Middle East", "Gaza"], "Nationality": ["Israeli", "Israeli-Lebanese", "Palestinian", "Lebanese"], "Date": ["October 7", "Sunday", "Wednesday"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["High Commissioner for Human Rights", "Supreme Leader", "Prime Minister"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": ["Islamist"], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://www.lexpress.fr/resizer/v2/WKUA2WCJVBB2FEMZ2EEO53MRRQ.jpg?auth=33fb33e1edce841c8522ef35193026b1b563ba7c4901c9503e9c931d03e02b96&width=1200&height=630&quality=85&smart=true", "keywords": ["Middle East", "Israel", "Iran", "Hamas", "Hezbollah", "Conflict", "Escalation"], "language": "fr", "pub_date": "2024-08-05 09:58:49+00:00", "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that his country is prepared to face Iran and its allies on all fronts.

The US, Israel's main ally, has strengthened its military presence in the Middle East while seeking to diplomatically de-escalate the situation.

Despite his party's landslide victory in the elections, the Labor Party suffered significant losses in areas with large Muslim populations due to their anger over the party's stance on the war in Gaza.
