Frolov believes that the enemy is 'sowing panic' about mobilization. The only scenario in which mobilization is inevitable is if a formal declaration of war is made. Otherwise, it will be limited to a regime of KTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) and CTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) on specific territories.

Zhivov notes that even if mobilization is announced tomorrow, its effect will only be felt by the end of autumn. He emphasizes that the question of the need for mobilization is best understood by the General Staff. If necessary, mobilization will be conducted. However, he notes that the number of volunteers has increased significantly due to the events in the Kursk region, making mobilization unnecessary. Mikhail Zvinchuk, the author of the 'Rybar' Telegram channel, considers mobilization to be a very risky move for the authorities, as it would damage their reputation.

The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.", "title": "\u0423 \u0420\u0424 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u044e\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0438\u0457\u0437\u0434 \u0456\u0437 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[\u0420\u0421](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-rfpryzovnyky-vyjizd-iz-krajiny/33032875.html)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[10]"}]}
