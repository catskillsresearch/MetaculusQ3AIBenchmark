According to a 'Foreign Policy' analysis, the likelihood of a large-scale war with Israel is higher than ever since the 2006 conflict. However, if Israel's goal is to permanently deter Hezbollah, a war may not be the best strategy, as it could have the opposite effect. Some analysts believe that the current situation with Hezbollah before the recent Israeli war in Gaza may have been the best scenario for Israel, with the border being relatively quiet since the 2006 war and the opposition to Hezbollah within Lebanon increasing. One of the strategies being considered by Israelis is to keep any limited attacks on areas controlled by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the Beirut suburb, and the Bekaa Valley. This would cripple the already struggling Lebanese economy, but the main strategic goal would be to push Hezbollah supporters to other areas, increasing social tensions. Israeli officials believe this would deter Hezbollah locally. Eran Lerman, a former Israeli national security advisor, said, 'I'm worried about Hezbollah's Shia supporters. Many people have scores to settle with Hezbollah since the Beirut explosion.' Lerman added that 'Israel has nothing against the Lebanese people, and even if a large-scale war breaks out, Tel Aviv will try not to target Lebanese infrastructure.' Some analysts believe that it is unclear how the Lebanese will react to a confrontation with Israel. 'Foreign Policy' suggests that if Israel wants to create conditions to destroy Hezbollah at the hands of the Lebanese, it needs to 'know what to do with Hezbollah's weapons and its followers, and not overdo it in a way that has the opposite effect of its campaign.' This is a difficult task. In times of war, it is unlikely that all the pieces will fall into place perfectly for Israel to achieve its goals. According to some estimates, Hezbollah has around 20,000 fighters, but its leader Nasrallah claims to have 100,000 fighters. As for any possible scenario for Israel's bombing of Tel Aviv's areas controlled by Hezbollah, there would be heavy losses of life, and the front could escalate into a long and unpredictable war, with the party striking deep into Israel. Former Lebanese General Elias Farhat said, 'While there is no doubt that Israel is stronger militarily, Hezbollah resorts to asymmetric warfare.' The party 'deploys its units in hiding places, tunnels, and caves that are not visible to the naked eye,' Farhat said, implying that Israel will not know who its enemy is. The general believes that a full-scale invasion would allow Hezbollah to cause significant damage in the heart of Israel, between Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem. 'We do not rule out Hezbollah's progress in the Galilee,' he said. Lerman notes that Israel understands the costs but if Hezbollah does not retreat - meaning stopping attacks on Israel and withdrawing to the Litani River as agreed upon in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 - then Tel Aviv will be forced to launch a strike. Writer Anshul Fauzdar concluded that there is only one way to get out of this chaos and anticipation, which is to start peace talks with the Palestinians and solve this existential problem, thus solving two problems at the same time.", "title": "\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0631\u062f\u0639 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u061f..\u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0642\u0627\u062a\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0644\u0629", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[\u0627\u0644](https://al-ain.com/article/hezbollah-israel-war-lebanon)", "provocative": "high", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[2]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/izrayil-likviduvav-komandira-raketnogo-pidrozdilu-1724135371.html", "article_id": "a06f0462-640f-5bf6-808b-c6f7c3120bf5", "classification": "Military", "country": "UA", "source_id": "\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430", "page_rank": 9268, "domain_url": "rbc.ua", "eng_title": "Israel Eliminates Hezbollah Commander in Lebanon", "entities": {"Person": ["Hussein Ali Hussein", "Joe Biden", "Israel Katz"], "Organization": ["Hezbollah", "IDF", "ASTRA", "Hamas", "UN"], "Location": ["Beqaa Valley", "Islamist", "Tayibe", "southern Lebanon", "northern Israel"], "Nationality": ["Iranian", "Palestinian", "Israeli"], "Date": ["October 7, 2023"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": ["US President"], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://www.rbc.ua/static/img/_/h/_hezbolla_gettyimages_1236495086_6450000f034dca0bef8cf5f76bcf018d_1300x820.jpg", "keywords": ["Hezbollah", "Israel", "Lebanon", "Israeli Defense Forces"], "language": "ru", "pub_date": "2024-08-20 06:33:48+00:00", "summary": "Israeli military forces have announced that they have struck several 'Hezbollah' arms depots in Lebanon, resulting in the elimination of the commander of the rocket unit.

Therefore, it is unlikely to miss this opportunity, especially since it has already cut more than half the path in this direction, on the eve of the US military mobilization, according to many informed sources, despite attempts to give it a defensive character. In this context, the best option for 'Tel Aviv' in the coming weeks is to conclude a prisoner exchange deal now, which would lead to the end of the war according to the current balances, i.e., keeping Hamas' authority in the Gaza Strip in some form, without the return of most settlers from the north and Gaza to their homes, and the continued development of Iran's nuclear capabilities, as well as the maintenance of Hezbollah's power, which means practically maintaining the axis of countries opposed to the United States on their interests, just like in the case of deterring Iran and Hezbollah from attacking through a precise and limited attack that does not lead to a comprehensive war. However, according to sources, it would be better for Israel to exploit the retaliatory response from Tehran and the Hariri neighborhood, and to implement a large-scale attack in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran to form the region for the coming years, which Netanyahu had announced before ten months when he said 'that the seventh of October will change the face of the region, and will allow 'Tel Aviv' to reorder it and make a fundamental change in its priorities for years to come.' In this reality, the equation of uniting the fronts becomes clearer, and the Palestinian front, whether in Gaza or the West Bank, will become a front of support for Hezbollah from one side, and a hindrance to the Israeli army's transition to the third stage in the sector, which may return the game to its previous rules before the eighth of October.", "title": "\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u062a\u062d\u0648\u0651\u0644 \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u063a\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u0625\u0633\u0646\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u061f", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[FM](https://www.vdlnews.com/news/407068)", "provocative": "high", "reporting_voice": "Analytical", "as_string_key": "[7]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.trtarabi.com/now/%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-18197434", "article_id": "e73b75aa-625c-5239-a984-22e2c073d054", "classification": "Military", "country": "US", "source_id": "TRT \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a", "page_rank": 379989, "domain_url": "trtarabi.com", "eng_title": "Injuries in Israel due to Rocket and Missile Attack from Lebanon", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": ["Hezbollah"], "Location": ["Yafa", "northern Israel", "Blue Line", "southern Lebanon", "Upper Galilee", "Zara'it", "Western Galilee", "Shetoula", "Gaza Strip", "Akka", "Nahariya"], "Nationality": ["Palestinian", "Israeli", "Lebanese"], "Date": ["October 8, 2023", "October 7, 2023"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": ["10,000", "132,000"], "Time": [], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": ["Yedioth Ahronoth", "Israel Radio"], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://images-cdn.trtworld.com/trtarabi/w720/h405/q70/20788965_0-556-5472-3081.jpeg", "keywords": ["Rocket Attack", "Israel", "Lebanon", "Casualties", "Gaza Strip"], "language": "ar", "pub_date": "2024-08-19 05:17:48+00:00", "summary": "According to Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, a direct hit occurred in northern Israel due to the attack by missiles and rockets from southern Lebanon.

Since the launch of 'Hamas' Operation Al-Quds' on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent devastating war on the Gaza Strip, 'Hezbollah' has continued to carry out operations against Israel, with the southern Lebanese border witnessing a significant increase in operations amid warnings of the danger of the situation and calls from all parties to stop the fighting and exercise restraint.", "title": "\"\u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0635\u0641\u0631\".. \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0626\u064a \u064a\u0647\u062f\u062f \"\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\" \u0628\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0634\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u0631\u0628\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646", "sentiment": -1, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[\u0633\u0645](https://samanews.ps/ar/post/585268/%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86)", "provocative": "high", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/renaud-girard-le-risque-d-une-nouvelle-guerre-au-sud-liban-20240624", "article_id": "7faa7ff3-ca78-52fd-8f2b-e24b41afc0cd", "classification": "Politics", "country": "FR", "source_id": "Le Figaro", "page_rank": 781, "domain_url": "lefigaro.fr", "eng_title": "Renaud Girard: 'The Risk of a New War in South Lebanon'", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": ["Hamas", "Hezbollah"], "Location": ["Gaza Strip", "southern front", "northern front", "Arab-Muslim world"], "Nationality": ["Israeli", "Lebanese", "Palestinian"], "Date": ["October 27, 2024", "October 7, 2023"], "Event": [], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": ["quarter-century"], "Sports": [], "Politics": ["axis of resistance"], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": ["Islamist"], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/1200x1200_crop/static.lefigaro.fr/f1/lefigaro/metas/og-image.png", "keywords": ["Lebanon", "Israel", "Hamas", "Hezbollah", "Gaza Strip"], "language": "fr", "pub_date": "2024-06-24 15:47:33+00:00", "summary": "The situation along the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon has significantly deteriorated since October 7, 2023.
