The channel reports that Syrskyi has begun to redeploy reserves of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to Glukhov in preparation for the operation. The goal of the operation, as described by the channel, is to cut off Rylsk from the Russian army's supply routes in the Korenevsky district and to expand the Ukrainian Armed Forces' foothold in Russia. A military expert from the Telegram channel 'Issa Pliyev' has also made a prediction about the Ukrainian Armed Forces' plans, stating that their main goal is to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The expert believes that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will use the city of Glukhov as a starting point for their attack, and that they will be supported by American F-16 fighter jets and Leopard and Abrams tanks. The expert concludes that the most likely scenario is for the Ukrainian Armed Forces to continue their success in the direction of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. 'Now the main thing is north of Tetkino, where the Russian units retreated after the bridges were blown up, is the city of Glukhov,' the expert said. 'There is also a road direction to Kursk. The nearest water obstacle is in Rylsk, where the Western wing of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is trying to expand its foothold... If we take the Kursk direction as the main strike, we should expect the introduction of at least two more brigades of strategic reserve under the cover of American F-16 fighter jets, remaining in reserve with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Leopard and Abrams tanks.

US officials are confident that Ukraine cannot hold its positions in Russia in the long term. Additionally, the movement of additional forces by Kiev to the Kursk region makes the entire front line on the Donbass weak, where Ukrainian forces are facing intense Russian attacks. 'Ukraine has expanded the front line, which carries a certain risk, as it requires more personnel and equipment to hold it, which in turn may exhaust some other part of the front or, more likely, reduce existing reserves,' notes a British analyst.

The operation, which took place in the same location where the fate of World War II was decided in 1943, was a tactical success, with Ukraine maintaining secrecy until the end and coordinating a well-synchronized attack with combined arms. The Ukrainian army has made significant progress, with 20 kilometers of territory lost by the Russians in a short period of time. The operation has several objectives, including attracting Russian forces from the Donb\u00e1s to alleviate pressure on that front, obtaining territory to be exchanged in peace negotiations, and elevating the morale of the Ukrainian people. However, the cost of opportunity of this operation is high, as Ukraine is not in a strong position, and the outcome is uncertain. The indicators to determine if Ukraine is doing the right thing are: 1) Can Ukraine maintain the buffer in Kursk until the beginning of 2025? 2) Can Ukraine reduce the pace of the Russian advance in the Donb\u00e1s? 3) Can Russia accelerate its pace of advance in the coming months? If Ukraine has calculated well, the situation at the front will freeze in the coming months, and Ukraine will have gained a valuable piece of Russia to negotiate with.

The Russian Defense Ministry announced that New York, a city in the Bakhmut district, is under their control, but the Ukrainian side claims that their forces still hold 20% of the city. To reach the next line of defense, the Russian army must take Pokrovsk and Toretsk, and then focus on Konstantinovka, a key stronghold in the Kramatorsk district. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have surrounded over 3,000 Russian soldiers in the Glushkovo district, cutting off their supply lines and leaving them with limited options for retreat.

More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of T\u00e9tkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petr\u00f3 Shukl\u00ednov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shukl\u00ednov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shukl\u00ednov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

The town of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the town of T\u00e9tkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the towns of Snagost and Apanasovka. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 square kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' he emphasized in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not transferred enough troops to the area to stop the Ukrainian advances, which have continued although their pace has slowed down after the first days of rapid progress. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the operation aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential.
