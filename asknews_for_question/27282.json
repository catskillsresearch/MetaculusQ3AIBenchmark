To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, G\u00e9rard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.", "title": "L\u00e9gislatives 2024. \"On craint de se faire tout voler, tout saccager \" : des commer\u00e7ants se barricadent par peur de d\u00e9bordements", "sentiment": 0, "medoid_distance": null, "markdown_citation": "[F](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/isere/grenoble/legislatives-2024-on-craint-de-se-faire-tout-voler-tout-saccager-des-commercants-se-barricadent-par-peur-de-debordements-3000293.html)", "provocative": "low", "reporting_voice": "Objective", "as_string_key": "[9]"}, {"article_url": "https://local.dailyherald.com/bridgeview-us-il/riot-fest-872-829-2034/2024-07-05-12682260-september-20-21-22-2024-riot-star-fest-seatgeek-stadium-bridgeview-il-frida-fall-sout-boy-pavement-the-offspring-performing-rob-zombie-smash-the-marley-brothers-st-vincent-sublime-performing-bob-mar-ziggy-stephen-julian-ky-mani-damian-d", "article_id": "e602256e-e043-50f9-b0bc-7c7db8e58235", "classification": "Entertainment", "country": "US", "source_id": "Daily Herald", "page_rank": 3822, "domain_url": "dailyherald.com", "eng_title": "FRIDAY, JULY 5, 2024 Ad - Riot Fest - Daily Herald (Paddock)", "entities": {"Person": [], "Organization": [], "Location": ["Bridgeview", "SeatGeek Stadium", "IL"], "Nationality": [], "Date": ["September 20-22, 2024"], "Event": ["RiotFest", "Riot Fest"], "Money": [], "Law": [], "Quantity": [], "Time": ["three days"], "Sports": [], "Politics": [], "Title": [], "Number": [], "Arms": [], "Product": [], "Media": [], "Transportation": [], "Religion": [], "Technology": [], "Space": [], "Medicine": [], "Language": [], "Science": []}, "image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/ownlocal-adforge-production/ads/12682260/large_images.webp", "keywords": ["Riot Fest", "Music Festival", "SeatGeek Stadium", "The Offspring", "Rob Zombie"], "language": "en", "pub_date": "2024-07-05 00:00:00+00:00", "summary": "Riot Fest is a music festival taking place on September 20-22, 2024, at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, IL.
