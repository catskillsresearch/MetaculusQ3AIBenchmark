      "George R.R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, has spoken about a major mistake he made when signing with HBO. Martin, who is also a producer on the series House of the Dragon and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, regrets that the success of Game of Thrones created high expectations for the final two books in the series. He also expressed regret over another mistake he made during the production of the first season of Game of Thrones. 'I probably made a mistake when we made Game of Thrones a TV show,' Martin said. 'We used a lot of unknown actors, and they did a lot of promotion with me. It really made my face well-known, which wasn't necessarily the best thing in the world.' Martin now finds himself recognized everywhere he goes, and he seems to be seeking some peace and quiet. 'I used to be able to go to McDonald's and get a cheeseburger without anyone recognizing me,' he said. 'But that's over now.'\n",

      "Some Amazon and Kindle users received a notification that 'The Winds of Winter' by George R.R. Martin was 'recently released' and available for purchase. However, when readers tried to follow up on the alert, they encountered an error message. The notification was likely a placeholder for the actual book, which has been in the works for years. Fans are speculating that the notification might be a sign that the book is finally being released, especially with the upcoming release of a new box set in October. Martin has not confirmed the release date, but has hinted that there will be a big announcement when the book is done. He has also shared that the book will reveal more about why and how dragons bond with men, a topic that was explored in the second season of 'House of the Dragon'.\n",

      "Martin Lewis has urged people to take immediate action after the decision by Ofgem to raise the price cap for energy from October 1 this year. The price cap will increase from £1,568 a year to £1,717 for a household with typical power usage. Martin Lewis, founder & chair of MoneySavingExpert.com, said prices are about double what they were before the energy crisis started. He warned that the vast majority of homes in England, Scotland & Wales will see costs jump 10% - so for every £100 you pay today, you'll typically pay £110. Lewis urged people to switch to cheaper deals, saying that prices for some deals still available were 7 per cent less than the new October cap - meaning people could save about £120. He also suggested using whole-of-market comparison tools, like MSE's Cheap Energy Club, to find the cheapest fix for their use and location. Lewis expressed concerns about the Government's decision to means-test Winter Fuel Payments, which will leave many pensioners missing out on a further £200 to £300.\n",

The boxed set will be available in October 2024, but no price has been announced. The set does not include the entire A Song of Ice and Fire story, as Martin is still working on the final two books, including The Winds of Winter, which has been delayed for over 10 years.

      "Disney+ has confirmed its upcoming releases for September 2024, including a highly anticipated Marvel series. The most notable release in August 2024 will soon be available, with the return of the cast of 'Only Murders in the Building' for season 4. The series will revolve around the murder of Sazz Pataki, the double of Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin). The first episode will be released on September 27, 2024, while the remaining nine episodes will be released between September and October. Another highly anticipated series is 'Agatha All Along', which is centered around the villain from 'WandaVision' played by Kathryn Hahn. 'Now stripped of all power, the infamous Agatha Harkness is nothing more than a shadow of her former self. Until the day a gothic teenager helps her to break free from this tangled curse. Agatha's interest is piqued when he begs her to walk with him along the legendary Witches' Road, a mythical path consisting of a series of magical challenges that, if overcome, reward any sorceress with what she lacks.' The series will be released on September 18, 2024. Other releases include 'LEGO Star Wars: Reconstruire la Galaxie' on September 13, 2024, and 'In Vogue: The 90s' on September 4 and 20, 2024.\n",

      "House of the Dragon season 3 will not start filming until 'earlyish 2025', according to showrunner Ryan Condal. Based on the previous season's filming and release schedule, this would put the release date at either April 2026 or June 2026. This is a significant delay compared to Game of Thrones, which had exact, year-long gaps between seasons for most of its run. The article argues that production in Hollywood is slowing down due to ballooning expenses and stretched-out timelines, leading to frustration among fans. It notes that even big-budget series are now experiencing 18-24 month gaps between seasons, and that House of the Dragon's delay is not an exception. As the article's author says, 'It's ridiculous' that it's taking so long to produce and release new seasons of TV shows.\n",

In the book, the Battle of the Gullet occurs before the Fall of King's Landing, where Rhaenyra and Daemon Targaryen sack the city and Rhaenyra sits on the Iron Throne. The battle is a major defeat for team Black, with Jacaerys Velaryon being killed and one of Rhaenyra's sons being captured. The battle also results in the destruction of Driftmark and the loss of a third of the Velaryon fleet's ships.

The confirmed cases are of the clade II variant, identified in 2022. As of August 10, there have been 53 reported cases of Mpox (clade II) in Mexico, with 51 of them in men. The majority of cases have been reported in the Mexico City (32), followed by Quintana Roo (8), Jalisco (3), and other states. In comparison, during the same period in 2023, there were 285 reported cases of Mpox. The World Health Organization declared an emergency due to a significant increase in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and several African countries on August 14.

      "Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.\n",

      "The Mexican Ministry of Health reported 49 confirmed cases of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in 11 states across the country from January to August 3, 2024. The National Epidemiological Surveillance Committee (CONAVE) also reported 212 probable cases of the virus. The CONAVE published an epidemiological alert to raise awareness among healthcare units across the country to report and monitor cases, reducing the risk of transmission and providing timely medical attention to affected individuals. The alert noted that Mexico has a Mpox surveillance system, which allows for the notification of probable cases through the National Epidemiological Surveillance System platform. The confirmed cases in Mexico have only been identified as clade II, with no cases of the new clade 1b variant detected. The country has a Response Plan for Mpox, which includes coordination, community involvement, diagnosis, and communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the International Public Health Emergency of Importance (ESPII), which has been activated in response to the alert. The symptoms of Mpox typically last for two to four weeks and include fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of energy. The disease progresses in two stages, with the first stage characterized by fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes, and the second stage marked by the appearance of small blisters and a rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body. The Ministry of Health recommends that the general population take precautions such as frequent handwashing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food and drinks, and wearing medical masks. They also recommend washing and disinfecting clothing, utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, and avoiding contact with lesions and other people if symptoms are present.\n",

      "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",

The confirmed cases in Mexico correspond to the clade II variant, identified in 2022, and as of August 10, 2024, there have been 53 cases, mostly in Mexico City. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global health emergency on August 14, 2024, due to the spread of the clade 1b variant and asked countries to strengthen their epidemiological surveillance systems. In response, Mexico has maintained active the National Network of Public Health Laboratories for the detection of this virus. Since 2022, Mexico has reported a total of 7,385 suspected Mpox cases, of which 4,130 have been confirmed. The majority of current cases are concentrated in men, with Mexico City leading the statistics with 32 cases. Despite the recent increase in cases in other countries, the Ministry of Health emphasized that the most dangerous variant has not been detected in Mexico, reflecting the effectiveness of the implemented surveillance and control measures.

According to Avila, there have been no cases of the Mpox clade I variant in San Luis Potosí this year, and only 10 cases were reported in 2022 and 5 in 2023. The symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and skin lesions, which can appear on the face, hands, and other parts of the body. To confirm a case, a positive result from a real-time PCR test or identification of samples analyzed by the Mexican Institute of Public Health (InDRE) is required. Avila recommended that the population frequently wash their hands, cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoid sharing food and drinks, and use face masks when near an infected person. She also advised to clean and disinfect areas where an infected person has been, avoid close contact, and properly dispose of contaminated items.\n",

Cases of mpox have been detected in Sweden, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and the more virulent clade 1b subtype has been detected in Sweden, the first time outside of Africa. The WHO is stressing that we know more about this virus and how it spreads than we did about COVID-19. Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus. The virus can be spread through human-to-human contact, respiratory droplets, fomites, and animal-to-human transmission. The epidemiology of mpox has shifted since the outbreak in May 2022, with a marked increase in cases reported among men who have sex with men. The clinical presentation of mpox includes symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and characteristic skin lesions. People with mpox can only transmit the disease when they are showing symptoms. The WHO's designation of mpox as a public health emergency underscores the urgency of addressing the disease's potential for rapid spread, particularly in populations with low immunity due to the end of smallpox vaccination programs. The recent emergence of the more virulent clade 1 strain of mpox raises significant concerns about its potential to escalate into a global pandemic, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Current treatment options include vaccination strategies, which differ between the two primary clades of mpox, and antiviral treatments such as tecovirimat, which have been found to be ineffective. The most effective strategy right now is to send mpox vaccines to Africa to try and stop the disease from spreading.\n",

      "Russian forces are pushing back Ukrainian troops from Russian territory. The Ukrainian military has been unable to advance into Russian territory over the past week, with their attempts to storm Russian positions in the Korenevo, Martynovka, and Ruska Konopelka areas being unsuccessful. The Russian military is using artillery and aviation to attack Ukrainian forces, including with three-ton bombs that can destroy everything within a 300-meter radius. Despite the Ukrainian military's failure to advance, the evacuation of civilians from eight border regions and the city of Lgov in the Kursk region continues, with over 130,000 people having already been evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the situation is under control and that the international community has been informed of the potential threat to the Kursk nuclear power plant. The Russian military has created three groups to defend the three border regions, and the Ukrainian military has been unable to break through their defenses. The Russian military has also been conducting operations to destroy Ukrainian forces, with many Ukrainian soldiers being captured or killed. The Russian government has stated that it will not tolerate any further aggression from Ukraine and will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens.\n",

      "The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that the Russian military successfully repelled attacks by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. According to the ministry, the Ukrainian forces lost up to 40 people and a significant amount of equipment, including a tank, four armored vehicles, and two cars. The Russian military, supported by aviation and artillery, was able to defend against Ukrainian attacks in four settlements: Malaya Loknya, Nechaev, Cherkasskoe Porochennoe, and Komarovka. Additionally, the ministry stated that attempts to attack the settlements of Vishnevka, Borki, Pogrebski, and Spaleniye were also thwarted. As reported by the commander of the 'Akhmat' unit, Apty Alaudinov, the situation in the region is under control of the Russian side. 'The situation is under control,' he said.

      "Ukraine has expanded its offensive in Kursk, capturing over 11 square kilometers of Russian territory west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The town of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the town of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the towns of Snagost and Apanasovka. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 square kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' he emphasized in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not transferred enough troops to the area to stop the Ukrainian advances, which have continued although their pace has slowed down after the first days of rapid progress. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the operation aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' he emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.\n",

Russian forces destroyed a M270 rocket launcher in the Bездрик area of the Sumy region, which was discovered from the air and quickly hit with an 'Iskander' missile with an air-burst explosion. There were no visible changes in the combat situation in the Glushkovsky district by the end of the day. Russian forces are holding positions in Tetykino. There were reports of Ukrainian forces entering the town of Otroba on the right bank of the Seim River, but there is no objective confirmation. In the Korenevsky district, there are reports of clashes on the approaches to Korenevo. Although the information is fragmented, the battles seem logical in the context of the Ukrainian forces' attempts to capture the city. In the Sudzhansky district, new footage has appeared from the western districts of the city, including the evacuation of Russian prisoners and captured hostages from local residents in the direction of the Sumy region. Battles are ongoing near Martynovka, and south of Kremenno, FPV-drone operators destroyed a Ukrainian BMP-1.

Since the start of the conflict, 121,000 people have been evacuated from the region. Smirnov announced that they have divided the relocation of the local population into two stages. The first stage includes four districts, a 10 km radius, as well as the entire Sudzha and Korenevo districts. Smirnov also stated that they have begun evacuating the entire border region and the areas near the nuclear power plant, including Bolshoe Soldatskoe and Lgov, starting on August 8.

      "Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note.

      "Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk. \n",

      "The US and UK provided Ukraine with satellite images and intelligence on the Kursk region after the Ukrainian military's invasion, to help track the movement of Russian reinforcements. According to the New York Times, the US and UK shared satellite images and other data with Ukraine to help the Ukrainian military command track the movement of Russian troops, which could attack Ukrainian forces or cut off their possible retreat routes to Ukrainian territory. As the number of territories occupied by Ukraine in Russia increases, the complexity of their defense for approximately 10,000 Ukrainian servicemen in these areas also increases. 'If they do not defend the territory with trenches and mines, it will be almost impossible to hold the territory,' warns one expert. US officials are confident that Ukraine cannot hold its positions in Russia in the long term. Additionally, the movement of additional forces by Kiev to the Kursk region makes the entire front line on the Donbass weak, where Ukrainian forces are facing intense Russian attacks. 'Ukraine has expanded the front line, which carries a certain risk, as it requires more personnel and equipment to hold it, which in turn may exhaust some other part of the front or, more likely, reduce existing reserves,' notes a British analyst. \n",

      "Ukraine has surprised the world, including Russia, by successfully launching an offensive in the Kursk region, a move that has left both the Russian neighbors and the Kremlin stunned. The operation, which took place in the same location where the fate of World War II was decided in 1943, was a tactical success, with Ukraine maintaining secrecy until the end and coordinating a well-synchronized attack with combined arms. The Ukrainian army has made significant progress, with 20 kilometers of territory lost by the Russians in a short period of time. The operation has several objectives, including attracting Russian forces from the Donbás to alleviate pressure on that front, obtaining territory to be exchanged in peace negotiations, and elevating the morale of the Ukrainian people. However, the cost of opportunity of this operation is high, as Ukraine is not in a strong position, and the outcome is uncertain. The indicators to determine if Ukraine is doing the right thing are: 1) Can Ukraine maintain the buffer in Kursk until the beginning of 2025? 2) Can Ukraine reduce the pace of the Russian advance in the Donbás? 3) Can Russia accelerate its pace of advance in the coming months? If Ukraine has calculated well, the situation at the front will freeze in the coming months, and Ukraine will have gained a valuable piece of Russia to negotiate with. However, if Russia increases its pace of advance in the Donbás, Ukraine will face the same problems, and the operation will have been a strategic mistake.\n",

The Ukrainian army's plans to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant have been foiled, and they are now trying to take the town of Korenevo. However, the Russian forces are putting up a strong resistance, and the Ukrainian army is suffering heavy losses. The Russian air force is also conducting airstrikes on Ukrainian positions in the Sumy region, disrupting their logistics and plans. The Ukrainian army's plans for a two-pronged attack, targeting both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants, are still unclear. However, a drone attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant on Sunday sparked a large fire, and the Ukrainian army may try to target the plant again. The Russian forces are also making gains on other fronts, including the Donetsk and Kherson regions. The Belarusian government has announced that it will be reinforcing its troops on the border with Ukraine in response to Ukrainian drone attacks on Belarusian airspace. This development may force the Ukrainian army to divert some of its troops to the north, which could be beneficial for the Russian forces.\n",

      "Russian and Ukrainian forces are advancing in the border regions of Donetsk and Kursk. According to both sides, their troops have made daily gains of one to two kilometers in the past three days, aiming to cut off the enemy's supply lines. Analysts believe that Russia is concentrating its attacks in a single area around the city of Pokrovsk, a key logistical hub in the Donetsk region under Ukrainian control. The Russian army has occupied several localities, including Nikolayevka, Zhelannoye, Orlovka, Lisichnoye, Ivanovka, Zalizne, and Spiridonovka, totaling 80 square kilometers, with nearly 59 square kilometers near Pokrovsk. Ukrainian forces are evacuating families with children from the area, with the head of the military administration of Donetsk, Vadym Filashkin, stating that the front is 'too close.' The Russian Defense Ministry announced that New York, a city in the Bakhmut district, is under their control, but the Ukrainian side claims that their forces still hold 20% of the city. To reach the next line of defense, the Russian army must take Pokrovsk and Toretsk, and then focus on Konstantinovka, a key stronghold in the Kramatorsk district. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have surrounded over 3,000 Russian soldiers in the Glushkovo district, cutting off their supply lines and leaving them with limited options for retreat. The Ukrainian army has destroyed three bridges over the Seim River, leaving the Russian forces trapped between the river and the border with the Sumy region. As stated by expert Yan Matveyev, 'Russia lacks the means to reverse the situation: either they retreat or send more soldiers who will eventually be killed or captured.' The Ukrainian army has control of 93 Russian localities and an area of 1,263 square kilometers, according to the commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n",

The journalist explained that the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is crucial for Russia, and if it stops working, it will not only affect ordinary Russians but also enterprises, causing losses and destabilizing the economy. Yakovina compared the Ukrainian military to Russian occupiers, saying, 'They are trying to draw a line of equality between the atrocities committed by the Russian army in Bucha and what is happening now in Sudzha. They can't do it (there's nothing similar), but Russian propaganda is trying hard.' He also shared a video of Ukrainian soldiers rescuing abandoned pets left behind by Russian residents in Sudzha and its surroundings, saying, 'Ukrainian soldiers are now busy rescuing the pets left behind by Russians, who were fleeing, leaving them without food, water, and dying from the heat.' Yakovina predicts that if the current situation continues, the Ukrainian army will reach Ryazhsk, Lgov, and then Kurchatov in a couple of weeks, establishing control over the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. He believes this could be a crucial turning point in the war, as the plant's shutdown would affect the economy of 15 Central Russian regions.\n",

The channel reports that Syrskyi has begun to redeploy reserves of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to Glukhov in preparation for the operation. The goal of the operation, as described by the channel, is to cut off Rylsk from the Russian army's supply routes in the Korenevsky district and to expand the Ukrainian Armed Forces' foothold in Russia. A military expert from the Telegram channel 'Issa Pliyev' has also made a prediction about the Ukrainian Armed Forces' plans, stating that their main goal is to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The expert believes that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will use the city of Glukhov as a starting point for their attack, and that they will be supported by American F-16 fighter jets and Leopard and Abrams tanks. The expert concludes that the most likely scenario is for the Ukrainian Armed Forces to continue their success in the direction of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. 'Now the main thing is north of Tetkino, where the Russian units retreated after the bridges were blown up, is the city of Glukhov,' the expert said. 'There is also a road direction to Kursk. The nearest water obstacle is in Rylsk, where the Western wing of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is trying to expand its foothold... If we take the Kursk direction as the main strike, we should expect the introduction of at least two more brigades of strategic reserve under the cover of American F-16 fighter jets, remaining in reserve with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Leopard and Abrams tanks. In my opinion, the development of success in the direction of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is the most obvious further scenario.'\n",

The bridge is a crucial artery for civilian and military logistics in the area. Russian propagandists claim that the Ukrainian military allegedly fired several American HIMARS rockets at the bridge, as well as two MLRS projectiles, one of which allegedly hit a car carrying Russian 'volunteers'. After the last strike, one of the bridge's spans collapsed. The area is now cut off, affecting villages such as Tetkino, Popovo-Lyazhachi, Volfino, and 27 others. Russian propagandist Roman Alekhin claims that the Ukrainian military allegedly also attacked a bridge in the village of Zvane in the Glushkovsky district and plans to capture a section of the district along the Seim River. Russian military propagandists predict further Ukrainian actions, including taking control of the E38 highway and attacking from the Glukhov side. Analysts note that the Ukrainian military has successfully expanded its territory of operation to 1,150 square kilometers, with 507.76 square kilometers under Ukrainian control and 640.92 square kilometers in a 'gray zone'. Ukrainian forces are likely engaged in battles in the Korenevo area, where another Russian column was allegedly destroyed.

It is unclear whether the Russian authorities were able to evacuate the women in the colony. The Z-channel also reported that fighting is ongoing in the villages of Ruska Konopelka, Cherkaske Porichne, and Komarovka, near Korenevo, and that Ukrainian forces are continuing to isolate the Glushkovsky region by attacking river crossings.

      "Given these factors, I estimate that some of the towns might be captured by mid-September (around September 15, 2024), which is before the question end date of October 1, 2024. However, this is a rapidly evolving situation and many factors could influence the timeline.\n",
      "27606 80 Ukrainian forces have shown rapid and sustained advances in the Kursk region, and they have already taken control of areas surrounding Tetkino. Given the momentum and the relatively shorter distance to Tetkino, there is a high probability that Ukrainian forces will capture Tetkino before October 1, 2024.\n",
      "27607 70 Korenevo is facing continued mechanized assaults by Ukrainian forces, with advances reported along the main supply routes. Given the ongoing operations and the strategic importance of this location, there is a substantial likelihood that Ukrainian forces will capture Korenevo before October 1, 2024.\n",
      "27608 60 While Ukrainian forces are actively engaging in the area around Glushkovo and targeting logistical routes, the defensive measures by Russian forces and the importance of the location will likely slow their advance. There is a moderate probability that Glushkovo will fall under Ukrainian control by October 1, 2024.\n",
      "27609 50 Bolshoye Soldatskoye's strategic position and the ongoing evacuation efforts complicate the situation. While Ukrainian forces are making advances in the region, the likelihood of capturing Bolshoye Soldatskoye by October 1, 2024, remains uncertain, hence a balanced probability.\n",

Given the current front lines and defensive fortifications, it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces will capture the plant before October 1, 2024, resulting in a lower probability.\n",
