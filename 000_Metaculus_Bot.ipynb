      "NASA's decision to leave astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on the International Space Station due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has been vindicated after the craft's return to Earth. The Starliner experienced a failed thruster and temporary guidance system blackout during re-entry, raising questions about its safety. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said, 'I think we made the right decision not to have Butch and Suni on board.' The issues with Starliner's thrusters, which failed during docking with the ISS, and overheating problems have led to a chasm between NASA and Boeing, with NASA viewing the data and uncertainty differently than Boeing. The next Starliner launch, scheduled for August 2025, is now uncertain due to the ongoing concerns about Boeing's space flight ambitions.\n",

      "The Baltimore Orioles (82-63) and Boston Red Sox (73-71) play the 2nd game of a 3-game series on Tuesday. The Orioles need a win to stay 1Â½ games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees. They have done well against the Red Sox this season, taking 7 of the 11 meetings and outscoring Boston 66-54. The recommended bet is the Orioles (-108) to win, as they have a good shot to get back on track. Additionally, the recommended bet is the Under 9.5 (-118) in the total, as the Under has hit in 3 of the last 5 meetings and both pitchers, RHP Albert Suarez and RHP Kutter Crawford, have been reliable for Under bettors.\n",

      "Focus Entertainment has announced that the first post-launch update for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be released this week. The patch will address persistent crashing issues, optimize performance, and fix a bug that has prevented some players from joining multiplayer matches. According to a Steam post, the bug has caused players to get stuck on 'Joining Server' and lose out on rewards after being disconnected from the server. The update will also include private PvE lobbies, ultrawide support, and the Battle Barge Sparring Arena. A post-launch roadmap has been shared, which includes several free updates, including Season 2 in Fall 2024, featuring new PvE missions, a new lethal difficulty, and new cosmetics.\n",

While there are severe technical issues and financial concerns, both parties appear committed to continue working on resolving these issues and have not indicated any immediate plans to cease the program.
