      "The World Health Organization has declared the mpox virus, a variant of monkeypox, a global health emergency due to its high mortality rate and ease of transmission. The majority of cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there have been 14,000 cases and 524 deaths this year. While the risk of mpox to the general public in the U.S. is considered very low, public health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to spread further across countries in Africa and possibly outside the continent. Dr. Anne Rimoin, professor of epidemiology at UCLA, said, 'an infection anywhere is potentially an infection everywhere,' and emphasized the importance of early detection and response. Local officials in California are monitoring the situation and have issued advisories to healthcare providers to be on the lookout for Clade I mpox in patients with recent travel to Africa and symptoms consistent with mpox. The CDC recommends vaccination for certain groups of people, including those who have been exposed to mpox and gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of the virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries. Rebecca Katz, a professor in the School of Medicine and School of Foreign Service, explains that mpox is an infectious disease that can cause painful rash, blisters, aches, and fever, as well as swollen lymph nodes. The virus has caused occasional outbreaks in parts of Central, East, and West Africa for decades, and epidemiologists have tracked thousands of cases a year in mostly Central Africa for the last 20 years. Katz notes that while the risk of mpox spreading widely in the U.S. is low, people need to exercise caution and vigilance. She emphasizes the importance of taking early action, devoting resources for surveillance and response, and ensuring access to healthcare, medical countermeasures, and support for infection, prevention, and control. The WHO is coordinating a global response to mpox, raising resources to support the response, and ensuring that populations that need drugs and vaccines are able to access them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported that the risk of mpox virus remains low in Europe, but there could be an increase in imported cases. ECDC expert Orlando Cenciarelli stated that individuals who have had contact with mpox patients are at a higher risk, but the disease generally presents as mild. However, those with underlying health conditions and weakened immune systems may experience moderate to severe illness if infected. Cenciarelli recommended that vaccines should be offered only to those at risk of infection, individuals with severe illness, and those traveling to regions where transmission is likely. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe, Europe recorded 27,000 cases and 10 deaths due to mpox in the summer of 2022. The WHO and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared mpox a public health emergency of international and continental concern. Africa CDC's latest data shows 17,541 mpox cases and 517 deaths across 13 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the epicenter of the outbreak, responsible for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has warned that it is 'highly likely' that new cases of the more virulent mpox variant, clade 1b, will be reported in Europe in the coming weeks. The ECDC has assessed the risk of sustained transmission among Europeans as 'very low', but expects more imported cases from African countries, where a surge of the new variant is underway. The ECDC recommends that imported cases be quickly diagnosed and treated to prevent local transmission of the new strain. Due to the high volume of travel between European and African countries, the ECDC recommends that EU countries publish travel guidance for people in areas affected by the mpox outbreak in Africa. The probability of infection in these cases was evaluated by the ECDC as 'high'. According to ECDC Director Pamela Rendi-Wagner, 'As a result of the rapid spread of this outbreak in Africa, the ECDC has increased the risk level for the general population in the EU and for travelers to affected areas.' 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of the new variant,' she added. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the new outbreak a 'public health emergency of international concern' on August 14. Since the new variant was first recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), cases have been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, and Rwanda, as well as in Sweden. According to CDC data, there have been 38,465 reported cases of mpox and 1,456 deaths on the African continent since January 2022, but the numbers include different viral strains. The virus is transmissible through close contact and sexual relations. Symptoms of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, typically appear 6-13 days after infection and include fever, headache, muscle pain, and skin lesions. Most people experience mild to moderate symptoms, but individuals with compromised immune systems may develop more severe cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak a global health emergency, but emphasized that it is not the new COVID. According to the WHO, more than 17,000 cases have been reported in Africa in 2024, and over 32,000 cases were reported in the US from 2022 to 2023. Mpox can spread through direct contact with infected animals, people, or contaminated materials, and anyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms or multiple sex partners is at risk. WHO regional director Hans Kluge said, 'The risk of mpox is not limited to people who are sexually active or gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.' Federal officials have stated that the risk of a widespread outbreak in the US is low, with only a few cases of clade II mpox reported each week. From 2022 to 2023, 58 people died from mpox in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has assured that the mpox epidemic is not a cause for panic. According to the WHO, the recent increase in cases is not comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to global lockdowns. The WHO has declared mpox as a public health emergency of international concern, but emphasizes that the situation is under control. The organization recommends that countries maintain vigilance and work together to combat the virus. Additionally, the WHO suggests that governments purchase vaccines. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate responses to mpox. The country is currently at the lowest level of global emergency for the disease, with 709 confirmed or suspected cases reported in 2024. The last reported death from mpox was in 2023. 'The situation is under control,' said the WHO, 'we are not seeing a pandemic like we saw with COVID-19.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africa CDC has declared Mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa due to the high risk of spread between neighboring countries and globally. The agency highlights cross-border movement, low public understanding of Mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacity as major challenges. The agency also notes that the vaccine shortage is a serious threat to containment efforts, and many African countries are highly vulnerable to Mpox infection due to widespread malnutrition and the prevalence of HIV. 'The high case fatality rate of over 3.9 per cent, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60 per cent of cases, further complicates the outbreak,' the agency said. The agency reported that heterosexual sexual activities, particularly among sex workers in Congo, are a major driver of Mpox transmission. Africa CDC Director General Dr Jean Kaseya appealed to the international community to provide support, saying 'Don't punish Africa. We need solidarity, we need you to provide appropriate support, this vaccine is expensive.' The agency is currently in talks with Bavarian Nordic to transfer technology to enable African manufacturers to produce the vaccine locally, with a goal of having 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa on August 13, 2024, due to the worsening situation on the continent. Since 2022, 40,874 cases and 1,512 deaths have been reported across 15 African Union (AU) member states, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024. The outbreak is driven by heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers, and raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates are also concerns. The Africa CDC Director General was advised by the 15-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) to declare a PHECS, which was redefined as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread. The ECG developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively, including disease severity, transmission dynamics, and public health risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Union Health Ministry in India has stated that there are no reported cases of Mpox in the country, but measures are being put in place for surveillance and management out of caution. The Ministry said that the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is presently low for India, but the situation is being monitored. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mpox infections are usually self-limiting and patients generally recover with supportive management. The transmission requires prolonged close contact with an infected case and is generally through the sexual route or direct contact with body/lesion fluid or contaminated clothing/linen of an infected person. The WHO has reported 99,176 cases and 208 deaths due to Mpox globally since 2022, and India has reported 30 cases since the 2022 declaration, with the last case being in March 2024. 'Although the possibility of a few imported cases being detected in the coming weeks is not entirely ruled out, it was assessed that the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is presently low for India,' the Ministry said. 'This is the second time the WHO is declaring Mpox a public health emergency, the last time being July 2022. It was revoked in May 2023,' the Ministry added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total registered in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain the mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' said Tedros. He reminded that the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday (13) by the Director-General of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment for sporadic cases of mpox clade I in Europe to 'moderate'. According to ECDC director Pamela Rendi-Wagner, 'There will be more cases in the coming weeks. That's the expectation... But regarding the risk [for the] general European population, we have to say that our assessment is that the risk is very low at the moment.' The statement comes as the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in parts of Africa. Data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that over 2,000 new mpox cases have been reported across Africa in the past week alone, with a total of 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths reported since January 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization has declared the mpox virus, a variant of monkeypox, a global health emergency due to its high mortality rate and ease of transmission. The majority of cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there have been 14,000 cases and 524 deaths this year.

The CDC recommends vaccination for certain groups of people, including those who have been exposed to mpox and gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty in assessing the danger of mpox has increased since 2022, when the disease spread worldwide. In new countries, especially in the Western ones, the mortality rate has been very low, around 0.2%. According to virologist Antoine Gessain, 'The danger to humans largely depends on (...) the quality of healthcare in the region where they live.' It is more likely that a patient will receive immediate and appropriate treatment in Europe or the United States than in most African countries. Therefore, it is probable that the current mortality rate of 3.6% in the DRC, the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic, would be much lower if the virus were to start circulating actively in Western countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, but the Lower Saxony State Health Office (NLGA) assesses the risk for Lower Saxony as low. Since the increase in Mpox cases in Lower Saxony in May 2022, the number of cases has decreased significantly due to intensive public health efforts: there were 58 reported cases in 2022, 2 in 2023, and only one so far this year (as of August 14). The cases are related to the 2B clade, as reported by the authority. The new virus variant of the I clade, which is associated with the outbreak in Africa, has not been detected in Germany so far. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) currently assesses the risk to public health in Germany as low, and the NLGA agrees with this assessment. NLGA President Fabian Feil stated, 'The NLGA does not currently assess the risk for Lower Saxony as increased.' In cooperation with the health authorities and the RKI, the situation will be closely monitored. While a limited outbreak is still possible, a significant increase in cases like in 2022 is not expected, according to the RKI. As a precaution, unvaccinated individuals with high infection risks, such as adult men who engage in same-sex relationships and frequently change partners, as well as laboratory staff working with infectious laboratory samples, are advised to get vaccinated. Early detection of infections is crucial to prevent transmission. Healthcare professionals should include Mpox in the diagnosis for individuals with unclear pock-like skin changes, especially if they have recently returned from Central Africa. The virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and causes skin rash, fever, and can be fatal, especially for children. The smallpox vaccine also provides protection against Mpox infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a risk assessment and updated guidance for mpox in Europe after a case of MPXV clade Ib was reported in Sweden. The ECDC stated that the likelihood of infection in the general population in the EU/EEA is very low, provided that imported cases are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented. However, the likelihood of infection for close contacts of possible or confirmed imported cases is assessed high. The ECDC also warned that the risk is high for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or living in nations most affected by mpox in Africa, especially if they have close contact with affected communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency and is committed to coordinating the global response to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency due to the outbreak of the mpox virus, also known as monkeypox. The new strain of the virus appears to cause more severe illness and spread more easily, particularly among children under 15 years old in Africa. The WHO has clarified that mpox is not the new COVID-19, and that the risk is not the same. The organization has recommended vaccination only for vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised individuals. The Jynneos vaccine, approved by the FDA in 2019, requires two doses administered four weeks apart and is considered safe for people with weakened immune systems, HIV, and dermatitis atópica. The mpox virus can be spread through close contact, including kissing and sex, as well as through contact with infected skin lesions and bodily fluids, or by touching contaminated objects. According to the CDC, over 17,500 cases and 500 deaths have been reported in at least 13 African countries as of early 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach does not see a significant Mpox threat to the population, despite the first case of the new variant in Europe. 'Mpox pose no great danger to our population at the moment,' he said. The case in Sweden does not change the risk assessment for Germany and Europe, as it is a virus variant that is currently only endemic in parts of Central Africa. Lauterbach stated that Germany successfully contained the first outbreak of the previous Mpox variant in 2022 and is continuing to monitor the situation. The EU's health agency ECDC has warned EU member states to prepare for an increase in cases, as the rapid spread of the virus in Africa has increased the risk for the population within the EU. The ECDC estimates the risk for the general population in Europe as low, but moderate for people who have close contact with possible or confirmed Mpox cases. For travelers to Africa who have close contact with infected individuals, the risk is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The WHO has activated its highest alert level, citing the risk of the Mpox virus spreading internationally again after 2022 and posing a health risk to several countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after independent Mpox experts, who met in an emergency committee, recommended it. The WHO is not taking any concrete actions, but rather wants to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' by the end of July. There are currently no known cases of the Klade I in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The Mpox virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and can cause skin rash, fever, and in severe cases, death, especially in children. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but notes that many cases may go undetected due to lack of testing capacity. The WHO had previously declared a PHEIC for Mpox in July 2022, but lifted it in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, vaccine supply remains a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of mpox in the EU as 'low' after a new evaluation published on Friday, following the international health emergency declared by the WHO on Wednesday. According to the report, 'the probability of infection with clade I of the human immunodeficiency virus (MPXV) for EU/EEE citizens traveling or living in affected areas and having close contact with affected communities is high.' However, they assure that the probability of infection is 'low as long as contact with affected communities is avoided.' 'In general, the risk for these populations is moderate and low, respectively,' they indicate. The ECDC also notes that the general risk for the general population of the EU/EEE is assessed as low, based on a very low probability and a low impact. However, they warn that the severity of the disease is moderate among people 'with underlying diseases, particularly immunocompromised individuals,' whose risk with respect to the disease is high. The ECDC also considers it 'very likely' that there will be more imported cases of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in the continent, but ruled out the possibility of sustained transmission if appropriate measures are taken. 'The probability of sustained transmission in Europe is very low, as long as imported cases are diagnosed quickly and control measures are implemented,' they stated. The ECDC recommended that EU and EEE countries issue guidelines for those visiting or returning from areas affected by the mpox outbreak. 'As a result of the rapid transmission of this outbreak in Africa, the ECDC has increased the risk level for the general population in the EU and EEE and for those traveling to affected areas. Due to the close ties between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more cases of clade I imports,' said the director of the ECDC, Pamela Rendi-Wagner. The ECDC advises health authorities to maintain 'high levels of preparedness plans and awareness-raising activities to enable rapid detection and response to any clade I case that may arrive in Europe.' 'To detect cases of clade I mpox in the continent and activate any response, it will be vital to ensure effective surveillance and (perform) laboratory tests, epidemiological research, and contact tracing capacity,' stated the ECDC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox situation in the African continent a public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global spread and a potential new pandemic. However, the level of danger posed by mpox is uncertain, and the mortality rate varies depending on the strain. In Africa, the disease has been present since 1970 and has a mortality rate estimated between 1% and 10%. In contrast, in Western countries, the mortality rate is much lower, around 0.2%. According to virologist Antoine Gessain, the risk to humans depends largely on the quality of healthcare in the region. In Africa, where the disease is more prevalent, the mortality rate is higher due to factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to proper medical care. The current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a mortality rate of 3.6%, would likely be lower if the virus were to spread to Western countries. The disease is also more contagious in areas with poor healthcare and among vulnerable populations, such as children and adults with compromised immune systems. The different strains of the virus, known as clades, also contribute to the complexity of the situation. The current outbreak in the DRC is caused by the clade 1, while the 2022-2023 outbreak was caused by the clade 2. The situation has led to confusion in the media, with some outlets describing the new subvariant 1b as more deadly than previous ones, without sufficient evidence to support this claim. According to virologist Marion Koopmans, 'we read in the main media things that are quite categorical about the gravity or danger of the new subvariant 1b, without much to back them up.' \n",
      "RATES Based on the provided information, this is a situation where we need to assess the likelihood of an event occurring by a specific date. I'll provide the requested information for each question:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Will the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public exceed \"Very Low\" before October 1, 2024?\n",

      "3. Time in days from today to end date: 39 days\n",
      "4. Specific date at which the event is most likely to occur: N/A (unlikely to occur)\n",
      "5. Likely event date in relation to question end date: The event is unlikely to occur before the end date\n",
      "\n",
      "The CDC currently assesses the risk to the general US population as VERY LOW. Given the short timeframe and the information provided, it's unlikely that this assessment will change significantly before October 1, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2-4. For the questions about exceeding \"Low\", \"Moderate\", or \"High\" risk levels, the same answer applies. It's even less likely that the risk assessment would jump to these higher levels in the given timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news indicates that while there are concerns about the new clade I variant in Africa, the risk to the US general population remains very low. The CDC and other health organizations are monitoring the situation, but there's no indication of an imminent significant increase in risk level for the US general public.\n",
      "27545 5 Based on the current assessment that the risk to the general US population is very low, and considering the short timeframe until October 1, 2024, it is highly improbable that the CDC's risk assessment will escalate above \"Very Low\". Current efforts and controls should maintain the risk assessment as is.\n",
      "27546 2 Given the current conditions and the timeframe until October 1, 2024, it is very unlikely that the CDC's assessment of the risk will exceed \"Low\". The risk to the general population is already assessed as very low, and there is no indication of an imminent significant rise in risk levels.\n",
      "27547 1 The probability of the CDC's assessment exceeding \"Moderate\" is extremely low within the given timeframe. The current CDC assessment is \"Very Low\", and there is no substantial evidence suggesting a rapid escalation in the level of risk in the US.\n",
      "27548 1 The chance of the CDC's assessment exceeding \"High\" before October 1, 2024, is negligible. The situation in the United States remains under control with the current risk assessed as very low, making it implausible for a sharp increase to a \"High\" risk level.\n",

Both Brockman and Schulman are co-founders of OpenAI, and their departures mark a change in the company after significant management turnover this year. Brockman, known as 'GDB' within the company, was a key ally of CEO Sam Altman when he was briefly removed from his position last year. Brockman requested to leave the company in protest after Altman was fired. In a post on X, he wrote, 'I'm taking a year-long sabbatical until the end of the year. First time to relax since founding OpenAI, 9 years ago. The mission is far from over; we still have a safe AGI to build.' Schulman, who was a researcher at the company focused on training AI models, said in a post on X that he will focus on Anthropic's security, but that concerns about this issue did not motivate his decision to leave. 'To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,' he said, referring to the alignment of AI with human interests. 'On the contrary, the company's leaders have committed to investing heavily in this area.' OpenAI stated that the team is 'grateful' for Schulman's work, including his alignment research. 'His passion and hard work have established a solid foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and in the broader field,' a spokesperson said. Schulman was hailed as the architect of ChatGPT, the popular chatbot of OpenAI. However, he said he receives 'too much credit' for the tool and cited the work of the entire team.

      "Jordan Thibodeau, a former Google HR manager, disagrees with Eric Schmidt's comments that Google is falling behind due to remote working. Thibodeau, who worked at Google for nearly a decade, believes that bureaucracy is the real issue. He said that Google had the technology to support remote work, but chose not to act on it. Thibodeau also criticized Schmidt's comments as 'out of touch' and 'hurting a lot of people who don't have a voice inside Google.' He noted that Nvidia, a competitor, has a more flexible work-from-home policy and is still producing well. Thibodeau also spoke about the return-to-office (RTO) push at Google, which he believes is causing 'tremendous fear and anxiety' among employees. He said that many employees were under the impression that they could work from home permanently, but were instead forced to return to the office. Thibodeau left Google in 2020 to join Slack's M&A HR team, where he was offered a full-time work-from-home job.

      "The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, has criticized the lack of political will from the European Union and the United States to influence Israel to stop its offensive in Gaza, which has left 40,265 dead in the past ten months. 'We have the capacity to influence Israel, of course we do', Borrell said, 'but what we lack is the will to influence'. He pointed out that in the past, Washington has acted to stop military aid and financial support to Israel, citing the 1982 Lebanon War and the pressure on Israeli authorities to attend the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991. Borrell noted that many of Israel's commercial exports go to the EU, and that the bloc has a policy of visa liberalization for Israeli citizens and supplies arms to Israel, just like the United States. According to Borrell, 'everyone reacts to effective pressure', and he lamented the lack of action from the US and EU, which have only denounced the high number of deaths. 'There will be a few more too many dead soon', he said. 'Do they want to use their influence or not? It seems they don't. There comes a time when diplomatic pressure is not enough and the phrase 'there are too many dead' becomes a phrase that alleviates your conscience but doesn't change anything', he added. Borrell also expressed skepticism about the progress of negotiations for a ceasefire. 'Every day without a ceasefire means more too many dead', he said. These comments come after Borrell confirmed that he will put on the table of EU member states the option of approving sanctions against members of the Israeli government for their support of radical settler attacks on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, following the latest attack in the town of Jit that left one dead. The sanctions will be discussed at the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers next week in Brussels, with a focus on the Israeli Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, who have clashed with EU diplomacy over their 'incendiary' statements against the Palestinian population.\n",

This contradicts statements made by US officials to the Washington Post that Netanyahu had offered concessions on the issue in a phone call with President Joe Biden the previous day. Israel will not accept the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Philadelphia Corridor, confirming that this was the real sticking point in the Gaza negotiations, not the prisoner exchange. Hamas had demanded the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphia Corridor, as a condition for reaching an agreement with Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza. Yesterday evening, Netanyahu's office denied previous media reports, stating in a statement: 'Israel will insist on achieving all its war objectives, as defined by the security cabinet, including ensuring that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel's security. This requires securing the southern border.' A source had reported to the US news portal Axios that President Biden had had a phone call with Netanyahu to encourage him to show more flexibility in order to reach an agreement for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza. According to Axios, the conversation focused on Netanyahu's new request that Israeli forces remain deployed along the Philadelphia Corridor. Israeli negotiators and US officials have stated that this new request represents a significant obstacle to a possible agreement.

Lammy is currently visiting Germany, his first foreign trip since the Labor Party's landslide victory in the British elections on Friday, which ended 14 years of Conservative rule and brought Keir Starmer to the position of Prime Minister. Lammy said, 'It's time for the United Kingdom to reconnect with the outside world.' He added, 'I want to return to taking a balanced stance on Israel and Gaza. We have made it clear that we want to see a ceasefire... We want the release of these prisoners.' He also stated, 'The fighting must stop, and humanitarian aid must be allowed in. I will use all diplomatic efforts to ensure a ceasefire.' Despite his party's landslide victory in the elections, the Labor Party suffered significant losses in areas with large Muslim populations due to their anger over the party's stance on the war in Gaza. The efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of prisoners in Gaza gained momentum on Friday after Hamas presented a modified proposal on the agreement terms, and Israel said the negotiations will continue this week. According to Gaza's health authorities, over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign on Gaza since October 7, 2023, in response to Hamas's attack on Israeli towns on the same day. Israeli statistics indicate that 1,200 people were killed and over 250 hostages were taken in Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Lammy said that Britain will seek to re-establish its global positions on some issues, including the climate crisis and major relationships, such as its relations with European powers and emerging powers. He added, 'Let's put Britain's exit from the European Union behind us... There are many things we can do together.'

Mediators - the US, Qatar, and Egypt - announced the resumption of talks next week in Cairo, after presenting a new compromise in Doha to implement an agreement on a ceasefire. An agreement has 'never been so close,' US President Joe Biden assured. Several Israeli politicians condemned the deadly attack in the West Bank by dozens of Israeli settlers.

The case involves a 10-month-old baby who had not been vaccinated in Deir Al-Balah. Two UN agencies have requested 'humanitarian pauses' in the fighting in Gaza to vaccinate over 640,000 children under 10 against polio in the coming weeks.\n",

      "The international diplomatic pressure is increasing to avoid a war between Iran and Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the G7 that an attack by Tehran and Hezbollah on Israel could happen in the next 24 hours. According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.\n",

      "Recent diplomatic efforts have attempted to prevent a full-scale war between Iran, Israel, and their allies. The negotiations, led by the US, Qatar, and Egypt, have been ongoing since August 15. The US has proposed a plan to help resolve the conflict, which includes a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and a significant prisoner exchange. However, Hamas has rejected the proposal, citing concerns about the presence of Israeli troops on the Gaza-Egypt border and the conditions for the release of its members from Israeli prisons. The US has also been working on a parallel plan, which includes a potential attack on Iran if negotiations fail. Meanwhile, France and the UK have been involved in separate diplomatic efforts, with the French foreign minister visiting Lebanon and the British foreign minister visiting Israel. The situation remains tense, with both sides waiting for the other to make a move. According to Israeli officials, the Iranian military has reduced its readiness for a potential attack, but the situation can change quickly. The next few days will be crucial in determining the outcome of the negotiations and the potential for a conflict.\n",

This decision has been a point of contention in the US-led efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and release hostages.

      "The world is waiting for Iran and Hezbollah's response to Israel's assassination of Fuad Şükr and İsmail Haniye in Beirut and Tehran. Meanwhile, in Gaza, a series of inhumane actions have taken place over the past week. Despite the importance of analyzing the events and the background, the media is filled with claims that Iran and Israel are engaging in a 'danışıklı dövüş' (a staged fight). In reality, the US and its Western allies have always used two methods in the region: bribery and threats. They bribe officials, media, and businesspeople in countries that are on their side, and threaten those who are not. The US has sent a massive naval fleet, including a nuclear-capable submarine, to the region. The US, along with NATO's five core countries (US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy), issued a joint statement warning Iran not to escalate tensions in the region and promising to defend Israel if it is attacked. However, this was not a warning, but a threat that disregards international law and the sovereignty of nations. Iran's Foreign Minister Kenani responded to this threat by stating that Iran will defend itself without seeking permission from anyone. The leader of the Yemeni Ansarullah Movement, el-Husi, said that the US's attempt to prevent the resistance's response has failed and that the US's massive military presence in the region will not deter the resistance's determination to fight against Israel. The US is also trying to revive the ceasefire talks in Qatar. However, the resistance has stated that it will only stop its operations if the war in Gaza is stopped. Iran and Hezbollah have stated that they will respond to the assassination of Fuad Şükr and İsmail Haniye, but not to the war in Gaza. The US is following the Doha talks closely, with CIA Director William Burns and diplomat Brett McGurk attending the talks. However, Hamas has not taken the talks seriously, with its Political Bureau member Usame Hamdan stating that Hamas will only participate in the talks if the Biden plan is implemented. The leader of the Gaza resistance, Yahya Sinvar, has refused to participate in the talks, stating that Netanyahu does not want the war to end. The talks have been unsuccessful so far, and the next round is scheduled for this week. In Turkey, President Erdoğan has stated that Turkey will take the same steps as it did in Karabakh and Libya if necessary. Israeli Foreign Minister Katz has responded by threatening Erdoğan, saying that he is following in the footsteps of Saddam Hussein. Azeri media has praised the Azeri army and people for their victory in Karabakh, and stated that the military aid sent by Turkey was not a help, but a payment for the aid. Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party is on a tour of Palestine, visiting sites such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Israeli aim is to capture the Arz-ı Mev'ud. The current conflict is not a Hamas-Israel war, but a larger conflict that involves the entire region. Turkey should be aware that the flames of war in the region will eventually reach its doorstep. \n",

      "The Middle East is a potential trigger for a global polycrisis, with the Gaza conflict escalating into a larger war between Israel and Iran. U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby warned that Iran could carry out retaliatory military measures on Israel soon, stating 'we have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks.' Iran has been expected to launch a bigger strike after attacking Israel in April with 300 missiles and drones. Despite calls for restraint from European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the situation remains volatile, with the U.S. military building up assets in the region. A long-sought Israel-Hamas ceasefire is increasingly uncertain, and the possibility of a larger conflict is growing.\n",

      "European countries are in intense communication with Iran to persuade it not to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas' former political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Meanwhile, French, German, Italian, and British leaders issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. German Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Monday, discussing the recent escalation in the region and ways to contain it, as well as bilateral relations between the two countries. Raisi emphasized that Iran welcomes expanding cooperation with all countries and believes in resolving issues through diplomacy, but will not give in to pressure, sanctions, arrogance, and aggression. Steinmeier stressed the importance of strengthening relations in various fields, highlighting the need for stability in the region, a halt to war and violence in Gaza, and calling for a ceasefire. The Vatican also called for avoiding the spread of conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, called for dialogue to prevent escalation in the Middle East. He expressed concern about the situation in the region and emphasized the need for all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution. The US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Iran to stop threatening Israel with a military attack. The statement emphasized that such an attack would have severe consequences for regional security. The US has approved $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel, despite calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza, killing over 131,000 people, mostly children and women, and injuring over 10,000, with many more missing.\n",

According to Netanyahu's office, 'Israel will insist on the achievement of all of its objectives for the war, as they have been defined by the Security Cabinet, including that Gaza never again constitutes a security threat to Israel. This requires securing the southern border.' This statement suggests that Israel has no intention of leaving the Philadelphi Corridor. The Philadelphi Corridor is a border region between Egypt and Gaza that has been a point of contention in the conflict. Netanyahu's office stated that securing the southern border is a key objective of the war. \n",

      "The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, has criticized the lack of political will from the European Union and the United States to influence Israel to stop its offensive in Gaza, which has left 40,265 dead in the past ten months. 'We have the capacity to influence Israel, of course we do', Borrell said, 'but what we lack is the will to influence'. He pointed out that in the past, Washington has acted to stop military aid and financial support to Israel, citing the 1982 Lebanon War and the pressure on Israeli authorities to attend the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991. Borrell noted that many of Israel's commercial exports go to the EU, and that the bloc has a policy of visa liberalization for Israeli citizens and supplies arms to Israel, just like the United States. According to Borrell, 'everyone reacts to effective pressure', and he lamented the lack of action from the US and EU, which have only denounced the high number of deaths. 'There will be a few more too many dead soon', he said. 'Do they want to use their influence or not? It seems they don't. There comes a time when diplomatic pressure is not enough and the phrase 'there are too many dead' becomes a phrase that alleviates your conscience but doesn't change anything', he added. Borrell also expressed skepticism about the progress of negotiations for a ceasefire. 'Every day without a ceasefire means more too many dead', he said. These comments come after Borrell confirmed that he will put on the table of EU member states the option of approving sanctions against members of the Israeli government for their support of radical settler attacks on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, following the latest attack in the town of Jit that left one dead. The sanctions will be discussed at the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers next week in Brussels, with a focus on the Israeli Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, who have clashed with EU diplomacy over their 'incendiary' statements against the Palestinian population.\n",

The statement read, 'We call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that could further intensify regional tensions and jeopardize the opportunity to agree on a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' The importance of ending the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has lasted over a year, was also emphasized. Despite the allied nations' support for Israel, the Israeli military has already implemented strategies to protect its borders from potential Iranian attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that they are preparing for any attack and have already met with the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) to discuss their readiness.

The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.\n",

      "The Department of Disease Control in Thailand confirmed the first case of the new variant of mpox, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14. The patient tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the department, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, but their progress will be monitored for 21 days. The confirmation of the clade 1b case in Thailand marks the first of its kind in Asia after the global emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Department of Disease Control, called for strengthened infection control measures, including close contact with patients, and assured that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points, especially at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, for passengers from countries with reported cases. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.' \n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of the virus and its potential for severe health impacts. The virus has been detected in Sweden, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and it's only a matter of time before cases increase across the Indo-Pacific. The more virulent clade 1b subtype has been detected in Sweden, which is the first time the strain has been detected outside Africa. The WHO is stressing that we know more about this virus and how it spreads than we did about COVID-19. Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus. The virus is spread through human-to-human transmission, respiratory droplets, and fomites, and it can also be transmitted from animals to humans. The epidemiology of mpox has shifted since the outbreak in May 2022, with a marked increase in cases reported among men who have sex with men. The clinical presentation of mpox includes symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and characteristic skin lesions. People with mpox can only transmit the disease when they are showing symptoms. Although mpox is less lethal than smallpox, it still poses significant health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations. The WHO's designation of mpox as a public health emergency underscores the urgency of addressing the disease's potential for rapid spread, particularly in populations with low immunity due to the end of smallpox vaccination programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As concerns grow about a type of mpox spreading in Africa that is believed to cause more severe illnesses, experts have expressed cautious optimism that this branch of the virus will not spread widely in the US or cause significant health impacts. This variant, known as Clade I, led the World Health Organization (WHO) to reclassify mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its spread to Sweden highlight the need for vigilance. Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University, commented on the expected spread beyond Africa, saying, 'It was only a matter of time before this spread beyond the African continent.' Meanwhile, in the US, no cases of Clade I have been reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several factors may reduce the risk of mpox Clade I spreading widely in the US, including immune defenses from previous vaccinations and infections, as well as better access to healthcare and living standards. Additionally, unlike Africa, where wild animals serve as reservoirs, the US does not have known animal vectors carrying mpox. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has adjusted the risk level for Clade I in Europe from 'very low' to 'low', notes Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, director of the agency. This change reflects the close ties between Europe and Africa, increasing the likelihood of imported cases. Clade I is considered more transmissible and severe than Clade II, which caused the global mpox outbreak that peaked in August 2022. However, experts like Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA, emphasize understanding the risks of Clade I within its context. She noted, 'The data on severity, mortality associated - all that is scarce. There are many questions about the population it's spreading in, its immune response, the transmission route, and the infectious dose.' Recent NIH findings show disparate results for the antiviral TPOXX, which did not significantly reduce the duration of symptoms of Clade I in a trial conducted in the DRC, but did correlate with lower mortality. This suggests that better medical care could reduce mpox mortality. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, of the CDC, highlighted that the advanced US healthcare system could help reduce deaths. Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Harvard, recognized the low current risk, but urged continued vigilance. He warned, 'The absolute risk in the US is currently low, although we must remain vigilant.' The CDC's proactive measures, including the strategic use of the Jynneos vaccine, appear promising. It is expected that the two doses of the vaccine will protect against Clades I and II.\n",

      "The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand confirmed the first case of the Clade 1 variant of mpox in Asia on August 22. The disease, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), was diagnosed in a 66-year-old man who traveled to Africa, the continent with the highest number of infections. According to the Thai government, he returned to the country on August 14 and presented fever and other symptoms compatible with mpox the next day, and was hospitalized for treatment. A team of health surveillance counted 43 people who had close contact with the patient, including those who also traveled to Africa, and were advised to observe for symptoms such as fever, skin rash, and swollen lymph nodes over the next 21 days. If any symptoms appear, the Thai Ministry of Public Health recommends seeking medical attention. In a statement, the ministry highlighted that at least six African countries have reported an outbreak of mpox, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, and Côte d'Ivoire. 'Passengers who have been to these countries will have their body temperature taken and be questioned about symptoms observed, especially skin rashes,' the Thai government emphasized. The patient, who is European, has been confirmed to be infected with the more lethal subtype of mpox, responsible for up to 10% of deaths, according to the Thai Department of Disease Control. In contrast, the Clade 2 variant is the most common type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 99.9% of those infected with this subtype survive.\n",

      "The World Health Organization has declared a global emergency due to an mpox outbreak, formerly known as monkeypox, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries. The current outbreak is driven by a new subvariant, clade 1b, which has higher rates of transmission and fatalities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US is not currently at risk due to the only known mpox cases being of the clade II variety, which is less severe. However, over 1,000 mpox cases have been reported in the US this year, with none caused by the Clade I strain. The unknowns surrounding clade 1b are driving concerns, and more than 17,000 cases and 500 deaths have been reported in 13 African countries this year. Symptoms of mpox include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, and treatment can depend on the infection and symptoms. Prevention is key, and receiving the smallpox vaccination is 85% effective in preventing mpox. 'The current mpox outbreak isn't likely to be anything like the COVID-19 pandemic,' according to the CDC.\n",

      "The World Health Organization has reinstated mpox as a public health emergency of international concern due to a large ongoing outbreak of clade I in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While experts are cautious about the potential spread of clade I in the U.S., they believe that several factors, including immunity from vaccination and previous infection, lack of viral circulation in wild animals, and better healthcare access, will mitigate the risk. Dr. Boghuma Titanji said, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The CDC has confirmed no reported cases of clade I in the U.S. to date, but experts warn that the absolute risk is currently low and that vigilance is necessary. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston said, 'We are more worried about clade I than we are about clade II.' The CDC continues to urge men with multiple male partners to receive both Jynneos doses, and only an estimated 1 in 4 of those considered at significant risk of mpox in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated.\n",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency, and governments across the globe are on high alert over the spread of the new variant. The clade 1 variant is of concern because it spreads faster and has a higher mortality rate compared to the milder clade 2 variant. The WHO recommends several vaccines for use against mpox, including MVA-BN, LC16, and ACAM2000. France has announced it will donate 100,000 mpox vaccine doses to countries suffering from the emergency, while the US has said it will donate 50,000 doses to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Public Health Agency of Sweden has confirmed the first case of the more infectious Clade I variant of mpox outside Africa. According to Magnus Gisslen, state epidemiologist, the patient contracted the infection during a visit to Africa where Clade I is spreading. Unlike the previous variant, Clade I is spreading primarily through household contacts and frequently infects children, causing a more severe condition and higher mortality. Sweden is prepared for the diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of Clade I patients, having previously indicated that isolated cases might be expected in the country. 'The news came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern,' said the Swedish health agency. 'Sweden reported around 300 mpox Clade IIb cases in the previous wave of infection,' the agency added.\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first case of mpox outside of Africa, in Sweden. The person was infected with the clade Ib type of mpox while in Africa and is receiving treatment. The WHO declared the outbreak in Africa a global public health emergency on Wednesday, and officials from the U.S. and Canada have stated that they have not identified any cases so far. Clade Ib is believed to cause a more serious type of mpox than the version that caused a public health emergency in 2022, and the virus is spread by close contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first case of a new mpox strain outside of Africa, in Sweden. The person was infected with the clade Ib type of mpox while in Africa and is receiving treatment. Public health experts warn that this could lead to rapid international spread of the disease. According to the WHO, there have been 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the outbreak began in January 2023. The global vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on getting shots to countries affected by the outbreak. The US and Canadian officials have not identified any cases so far, but the CDC is watching the outbreak closely. Dr. Brian Ferguson said, 'There will likely be more here and in other parts of the world as there are currently no mechanisms in place to stop imported cases of mpox happening.' Lawrence Gostin added, 'The emergence of a case on the European continent could spur rapid international spread of mpox.'\n",

      "Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the upsurge of clade I mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and several other African countries. The Biden-Harris Administration has established an incident response structure to ensure a coordinated response and to take a proactive approach to U.S. domestic preparedness for potential clade I mpox cases. The Administration has been working since December 2023 to prepare domestically and has distributed over one million vials of the JYNNEOS vaccine across the United States. The U.S. government has also provided an additional $55 million in financial support to DRC and other affected countries in the region. The United States is working with other countries, WHO, and international partners to encourage additional donations of vaccines and to address challenges with vaccine delivery. The Administration will continue its whole-of-government response to this growing outbreak, building on lessons learned from the 2022 mpox response. 'Those who have already had clade IIb mpox or who are fully vaccinated against it are expected to be protected against clade I mpox,' according to the CDC. 'At this time, CDC and WHO do not discourage travel to DRC or elsewhere due to the mpox outbreaks,' they added. The U.S. government support for the mpox response builds on longstanding partnerships in global health security and development with DRC and throughout Africa.\n",

      "Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.\n",

      "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.\n",

      "Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024.
