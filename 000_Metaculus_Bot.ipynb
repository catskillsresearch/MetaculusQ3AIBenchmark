      "The Atlantic Ocean has been relatively calm, with the last hurricane to form in its waters being Ernesto. However, the necessary ingredients are in place: record-breaking ocean temperatures and the formation of La Niña in the Pacific could combine to produce one of the most active periods in history in the Atlantic. Several forecasts have warned of an 'extraordinary' hurricane season. However, after Ernesto dissipated on August 20, a lull in cyclones occurred, leading experts to question whether the forecasts had failed. 'What the devil is going on with the Atlantic hurricane season? Will it be a huge failure of the predictions?' asked University of Colorado meteorologist Phillip Klotzbach on his X account. His first response: there is a possibility that the predictions will still hold, as the Atlantic seems to have awakened. A promising start Alberto was the storm that opened the season in the Atlantic Ocean, although it did not become a hurricane, its presence in the Gulf of Mexico was enough to trigger torrential rains in Mexican territory and floods in the United States. Shortly after the storm made landfall, a low-pressure system developed into Beryl, considered the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in Atlantic waters. The presence and characteristics of both storms began to give body to the forecast issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and supported by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO): a higher-than-normal activity was expected, with the possibility of up to 11 hurricanes. Debby and Ernesto soon followed, resulting in a 'very above-average' season until mid-August, according to the University of Colorado's latest report. However, and contrary to all expectations, the dispersal of Ernesto also marked the dissolution of expectations: during the month in which the Atlantic is climatologically very busy, the waters remained calm. Until September 4, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was monitoring four areas with possible cyclone formation, but the chances of them becoming a storm were very low. 'A handful of 'maybe's and a few 'probably not's on the map today. You can't ask for a more docile aspect to start September,' said hurricane expert and expert in cyclonic waves, Michael Lowry on his social media. Without new hurricanes in sight, the group of researchers from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Colorado State University began to seek explanations. Is there no reason? There are several reasons to explain why the forecasts (which seemed more than accurate) began to falter in the face of the wind and the sea. And it is that, more than one factor could have 'conspired' against them, as explained by Philip J. Klotzbach and colleagues from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Colorado. Firstly, the researchers detected a change in route that could be key: usually when the monsoon trough moves north it brings more cyclones, however, this year it moved so far north that it caused dry air in the subtropics. Since a lot of humidity is required for hurricane formation, this type of air ended up stifling the possibilities. Interestingly, the fact that the trough moved further than expected could be directly related to one of the conditions that initially triggered the rapid formation of a powerful hurricane: high sea temperatures. On the other hand, despite the record-breaking heat remaining in the sea, this year there is a new element that was not experienced in 2023: high temperatures in the troposphere, the layer of the atmosphere that is in direct contact with the Earth's surface. Thus, the record-breaking heat of the ocean, added to that of the troposphere, is causing a stabilizing effect that ends up suppressing the creation of cyclones. The third element that could be hindering the process is the wind: the increase in its sudden changes in direction and speed (better known as shear) in the eastern Atlantic 'may be one of the reasons why we have seen a very anemic performance,' as detailed in the University of Colorado report. Finally, the movement of a key piece ended up disfavoring the game: it is the Madden-Julian oscillation, a zone of low pressure that travels around the world in a period of 30 to 60 days and has effects both in the ocean and in the atmosphere. According to meteorologists, usually its presence favors the formation of large hurricanes (category 3 or higher), however, after taking some steps to the east and locating itself between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it caused more wind shear. Then.... What can be expected? The hurricane season has had two faces so far this year: the first, energetic, the second, extremely calm. Now, if the calm has ruled for a few weeks, it seems that the Atlantic is turning back to its more agitated side. Despite the elements that the climate forecasted a 'below-normal' activity in the following weeks, on September 9, the formation of Francine in the Gulf of Mexico was achieved. In addition, just two days later, the NHC alerted the monitoring of a perturbation with high probabilities of becoming the next tropical storm: Gordon. Will it then be the rest of the season a failure or will the expectations be maintained? The experts still do not rule out the possibility of an agitated cyclone period. 'The continued extreme warming of the Atlantic, the trend towards La Niña and the forecast of low wind shear indicate that the season can still recover during the second half. The climatological peak of the season is September 10,' Klotzbach said. It is expected that the conditions will continue to improve from the second half of September, not only due to the behavior of the wind, but also because the atmospheric stability could be altered. 'Climatologically, the surface temperatures of the sea and the ocean heat content increase until the end of September and early October, while the temperatures in the upper levels begin to decrease.' Therefore, a hyperactive cyclone season is still possible. Although, as the meteorologists warn, the forecasts can always change. \n",

      "Citi analysts have raised their short-term price forecast for lithium carbonate to $14K/metric ton and hydroxide to $14.2K/ton, citing investor demand to cover short positions. However, they expect the rally to fade over the next 6-12 months as higher prices may trigger a supply response, potentially leading to a loosening of lithium balances. This comes after lithium futures surged 9% and lithium miner share prices spiked following reports that China's CATL, the world's largest battery producer, was suspending a mine that accounts for 5%-6% of global supply. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights analyst Alice Yu, 'There is a stronger signaling effect from CATL's cut,' as the mine's suspension reinforces the expectation of a prolonged weakness in downstream demand.\n",

      "Rationale Given the recent price of lithium carbonate at CNY 73,500, the market's volatility, and the potential supply curtailments by CATL, the situation is poised for fluctuations. While a decline below CNY 70,000 is possible, it is less than even odds within the short time frame until October 1, 2024. Therefore, I assess the probability as 45%. \n",
