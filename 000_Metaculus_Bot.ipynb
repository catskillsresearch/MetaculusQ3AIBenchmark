      "Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is set to leave the International Space Station on Friday, months later than planned, without the two astronauts it carried into orbit. The capsule will return to Earth in about six hours and land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will stay at the ISS for the rest of the year and return to Earth in February aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The return of Boeing's Starliner capsule 'Calypso' ends a test flight that was much longer than initially predicted, with Boeing investigating an issue with the capsule's thrusters for three months. NASA officials decided to send Starliner back empty to 'further understand the root causes' of the spacecraft's issues, which could threaten Boeing's future involvement in NASA's Commercial Crew program.\n",

      "Egyptian actor Naji Sawiris expressed his support for unity and peace in the region, calling for an end to the escalation of tensions between Egypt, Somalia, and Ethiopia. He shared a tweet from an Ethiopian account, writing 'You are right', which stated 'Egypt, Somalia, and Ethiopia are like one state. We should not allow those who drum the beat of war to succeed in their attempts to destabilize us. Destabilizing the Horn of Africa will lead to the destruction of Africa.' The account added 'Africa yearns for unity, not war.' Relations between Somalia and Ethiopia have been tense in recent months, following the signing of a disputed agreement between Addis Ababa and the breakaway region of Somaliland. The agreement aims to secure a piece of land in the Gulf of Aden for Ethiopia, in exchange for recognizing Somaliland as an independent republic. Ethiopia has already sent a diplomat to Hargeisa, marking a significant step in diplomatic recognition. In response, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud visited Cairo, seeking Egyptian support, and a defense agreement was signed between the two countries in August, with Egypt sending military equipment and troops to Mogadishu. It is expected that Egypt will participate in a new UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia next year.\n",
