      "The Drug Enforcement Agency's proposal to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III has been met with skepticism from local marijuana professionals. Dylan Mattole, a cannabis cultivator, believes that rescheduling is an incremental improvement, but does not address the major issue of marijuana remaining illegal at the federal level. He suggests that de-scheduling would be a more effective solution. Ross Gordon, policy director for the Humboldt County Growers Alliance, shares similar concerns, stating that rescheduling could lead to greater regulation due to the FDA's possible involvement. Both men agree that the cannabis industry needs to emulate other craft industries, but this requires the ability to ship products directly to consumers, which is currently illegal under federal law. The federal hearing on rescheduling is set for December 2, and the final decision will likely occur after the next president is elected. Gordon notes that while rescheduling may have some modest positive effects, the consequences are still unknown.\n",

      "The US stock market is expected to rise on Thursday after losses in the middle of the week. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are in focus, with the company's stock down 3.5% pre-market after a strong run. However, many analysts expect solid quarterly earnings from the US chipmaker, have raised their price targets, and reaffirmed their positive investment opinions. Salesforce also impressed with its numbers and strong outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to rise 0.7% to 41,393 points, according to broker IG, and is on track to reach its record high of over 41,400 points set on Monday. The Nasdaq-100 is also expected to rise 0.5% to 19,444 points. Nvidia's stock has been affected by investors' doubts about the company's outlook, despite analysts' positive views on its solid and positive earnings. Portfoliomanager Thomas Altmann from QC Partners said that Nvidia's outlook 'disappointed at some points.' A stock strategist noted that Nvidia's strong price increase of 150% since the beginning of the year has driven the entire market rally, but the high expectations for the company's next earnings report made it difficult to meet. Salesforce's stock rose by over 4% pre-market after the company raised its annual targets. Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity company, also exceeded expectations, but its stock fell by 2% pre-market. HP Inc's stock fell by 3% pre-market due to declining profits and missing market estimates. Dollar General's stock fell by 24% pre-market after weak earnings and lowered annual targets, while Dollar Tree fell by 9%. Best Buy, however, impressed with raised targets and its stock rose by 14%.\n",

      "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is reportedly seeking a new funding round that could value the company at $100 billion. According to Bloomberg sources, OpenAI has been in talks with Thrive Capital and Microsoft since December to raise around $1 billion. This would be in addition to the $86 billion valuation achieved through an employee stock sale earlier this year. OpenAI's financial situation is complex, with the company reportedly losing billions of dollars annually despite generating significant revenue from ChatGPT and its AI models. However, the company's revenue is growing, driven by the success of its GPT-4o model and its partnership with Apple. As Apple's Siri and other iOS features will integrate ChatGPT, this could lead to increased adoption and revenue for OpenAI.\n",

      "Tesla is attempting to make a comeback in the upward trend, but it still needs to surpass the 200 Euro mark, according to chart analysts. However, the company may face a new challenge as J.D. Power has lowered its sales forecast for US electric vehicles for the current year. This is not a positive development for Tesla, which is already struggling with declining global demand. As a result, the market reaction to Tesla's stock has been a downward trend, but chart technicians believe that the 200 Euro mark is still achievable and important. As Chartanalysten said, 'It's going to take more than just a few days to turn the trend around, but we're optimistic that Tesla can make a comeback.' \n",
