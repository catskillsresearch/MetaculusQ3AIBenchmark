The attack has forced over 100,000 civilians to flee and led to a Russian 'counter-terrorism operation.'

      "The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.\n",

      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances of up to 10 kilometers in the Russian oblast of Kursk, as part of ongoing mechanized offensive operations. The analysis is based on the examination of geolocated videos published in the last 48 hours, which show Ukrainian armored vehicles advancing to positions 10 kilometers from the border. 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said. A Russian internal source stated that Ukrainian forces have taken 45 square kilometers of territory within the Kursk oblast since launching the operation on August 6. Other Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces have captured 11 settlements, including Nikolaevo-Daryino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, and are operating within Lyubimovka. Videos shared on Telegram show civilians fleeing the areas involved in the clashes, with hundreds of people reportedly evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the Ukrainian offensive as 'a provocation,' while the Ministry of Defense initially denied the presence of Ukrainian soldiers and equipment in Russian territory before later admitting to the breach and providing information on the effective intervention of Russian forces, as said by 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine is advancing towards its five objectives in Kursk, forcing Russia to continue evacuating civilians. The Ukrainian army has made significant gains, with troops reaching the outskirts of Korenevo and Gir'i, and are now focused on taking control of key communication routes and infrastructure. The five objectives are: 1) to reach the city of Rylsk and take control of the E38 highway, a crucial communication route; 2) to take control of the city of Lgov, a key industrial center; 3) to reach the outskirts of Kromskye Byki, a village that provides access to Lgov; 4) to take control of the city of Kursk, the capital of the region; and 5) to reach the border with Belgorod and potentially launch a second offensive. Ukraine's goal is not to occupy the territory, but to force Russia to change its strategy and divert troops from the Donbás front. 'The Kremlin cannot allow the Kursk nuclear power plant to fall into Ukrainian hands,' said a source. 'It's a very improbable scenario, but if they keep advancing, the situation will become very serious and Russia will have to send its best troops to protect the plant.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia has reportedly withdrawn several troops from the heavily contested front in southern Ukraine to defend its own territory in the Kursk region. According to a Ukrainian military spokesperson, Dmytro Lykhoviy, 'Russia has moved several of its units from both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in southern Ukraine.' The Ukrainian army has continued to advance on Russian territory, with the military now controlling over 1,000 square kilometers in the region. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its offensive in the eastern region of Donetsk, particularly in the city of Pokrovsk, in an attempt to counter Ukrainian advances in Kursk.\n",

      "Ukraine has launched a major operation in Russia's Kursk region, marking the first time since the start of the invasion that Ukrainian troops have entered Russian territory. According to Jen Spindel, a foreign policy and security expert, this move is a sign of a new strategy for Ukraine, which cannot continue to fight the war in the same way it has been for the past two years. Spindel said, 'Ukraine cannot continue to fight this war in the same way it has been for the past two years. It just simply doesn't have the manpower or weapon stores to do so.' The goal of the operation is to 'bring the conflict into Russia' and force Russia to divert its forces from bombing and causing destruction in Ukraine. Ukraine has already gained control of around 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, and experts believe that this move could be a turning point in the war. However, some experts, such as Gustav Gressel, are skeptical about the situation, calling it 'good for morale, but insignificant in the war.' \n",

      "Ukrainian forces have made significant advances in the Russian region of Kursk, occupying 1,000 km², according to sources in Kiev. This advance marks a milestone in the Ukrainian offensive, which is the largest attack on Russian territory since the start of the conflict in February 2022. As stated by Ukrainian officials, 'This is a significant victory for our forces and a major blow to the Russian army.' The advance comes after months of Ukrainian retreats on the eastern front. Ukrainian forces launched the largest offensive on Russian soil since the start of the war on August 6, aiming to reverse Russian control over their own territory. Since then, Russian forces have continued to advance, capturing an additional 69 km², bringing the total territory gained by Russia to 111 km². According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), since the beginning of 2024, Russia has advanced 1,360 km² in Ukrainian territory, while Ukrainian counterattacks have only recovered 20 km² in the same period. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Moscow has taken control of 65,891 km² of Ukrainian territory. Including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and previously controlled areas, Russia currently occupies 108,070 km² of Ukraine, representing 18% of the internationally recognized territory.\n",

      "According to Russian sources relayed by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and analyzed by AFP on Tuesday, Ukrainian troops have advanced 800 km2 in the Russian region of Kursk. Ukraine has claimed control of 1,000 km2 of Russian territory in this border region. After months of retreat on the Eastern front, Ukraine launched its largest cross-border attack against Russia on August 6. In comparison, Russia has advanced 1,360 km2 in Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024, while Ukraine's counter-offensives on its own territory have only reclaimed 20 km2, according to AFP analysis. Ukraine's failed summer counter-offensive in 2023 allowed Kiev to retake up to 250 km2 from Russian forces in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, Russian advances in Ukrainian territory have not slowed since the August 6 attack: the Russian army has conquered an additional 69 km2 since then and 111 km2 in total since early August, adding to the 201 km2 taken in July. In total, Russia has taken 65,891 km2 of Ukrainian territory since the invasion on February 24, 2022. With Crimea annexed in 2014 and Eastern regions already under Russian control before the war, Russia occupies 108,070 km2, or 18% of Ukraine's internationally recognized borders.\n",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin was not pleased with the news from the southern region of Kursk, as Ukrainian forces, backed by tanks and air defenses, advanced into the area. The Russian soldiers were surrendering, and hundreds of Russian civilians in the city of Sudza and surrounding areas were fleeing. In two and a half years of war, this was an unprecedented Ukrainian invasion of Russia. Putin described it as 'another provocation' from Kiev. The acting governor of the region declared a state of emergency, describing the situation as 'very difficult.' The Ukrainian army's advance on Kursk was a bold move, described by one analyst as 'the least obvious action.' Despite losing territory in eastern Donetsk, Ukraine chose to send experienced units to Russian territory to embarrass the Kremlin. George Barros from the Institute for the Study of War in Washington says the Ukrainians 'achieved a tactical surprise against significant obstacles, and they are currently exploiting Russia's lack of preparedness in its border regions.' Earlier this month, a Russian unit responsible for defending this part of the border retreated from its positions, and dozens of soldiers were captured, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to express 'his personal gratitude to our warriors and units working on 'replenishing the exchange box,' by taking the occupiers prisoner and helping to liberate our people from Russian captivity.' A Russian convoy was hit by a rocket near the town of Rylsk on Thursday evening, possibly because the Ukrainians managed to breach many of the traffic cameras that are a feature of Russian highways. In the face of little resistance, and with Russian communications disrupted in the area due to effective electronic warfare, the Ukrainian units advanced more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) into Kursk in the first two days of the operation. Good intelligence allowed the advanced units to move forward in a chaotic battlefield, often bypassing Russian defenses. By Friday, the Russian authorities had lost control of at least 250 square kilometers of territory, according to several independent analyses and CNN maps. Among the places that came under Ukrainian control was a gas pipeline crossing near the border that supplies Russia with large quantities of natural gas to Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.' \n",

      "Ukraine has launched a surprise offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, with troops advancing 10-15 kilometers into Russian territory. The offensive, which began on Wednesday, has seen Ukrainian forces control the city of Sudzha and reach as far as Koronevo, 30 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used donated German Marder armored vehicles in the operation, which has been described as the largest advance since November 2022. The move has caught Russia off guard, with at least 20,000 Russian troops said to have crossed the border without warning. The Ukrainian government has not publicly stated the goals of the operation, but analysts believe it may be aimed at securing territory for future negotiations or to pressure Russia to withdraw from the Donetsk region. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some critics arguing that Ukraine should focus on supporting its troops in the Donetsk region rather than opening a new front.\n",

      "On August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) entered the territory of Russia in the area of the city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast. The scale of the operation remains unknown. According to reports, several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade of the VSU, supported by special forces and air defense systems, crossed the border and by the evening of August 7, had advanced deep into Russian territory. They were met by weak forces, including border guards and infantry from a 'polk prikrytiya granitsy' (a border protection unit) created in 2023, which was largely composed of conscripts. The VSU was able to push through the Russian defenses, despite being hit by Russian air strikes and 'Iskander' missiles. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. By the evening of August 7, the VSU had achieved several successes, including capturing the 'Sudzha' border crossing and taking several dozen Russian border guards prisoner. They also captured a gas measurement station near the border crossing. The VSU advanced west of the border crossing, reaching the road from Rylsk to Sudzha in the area of Sverdliovo, where they were hit by Russian air strikes and operational-tactical missiles. The main part of the VSU group turned towards Rylsk along the road, capturing the villages of Leonidovo and Zeleny Shlyakh. However, it is unclear if the VSU has entered the city of Sudzha itself, although they have approached it from the west and possibly from the south. The city's quarters have been heavily damaged by Ukrainian shelling, and many civilians remain in the area.\n",

      "Ukrainian forces have made significant gains in the Kursk region of Russia, occupying over 1000 square kilometers of territory and advancing up to 35 kilometers deep. The operation, which began a week ago, has been successful in catching the Russian military off guard, with Ukrainian forces taking control of key roads and infrastructure. The Russian military has been slow to respond, with some reports suggesting that they are still trying to understand the scale of the Ukrainian advance. The Ukrainian military has stated that their goal is to weaken the Russian military's grip on the region and create a buffer zone, but some analysts believe that the operation may be part of a larger strategy to push the Russians out of Ukraine altogether. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some experts warning that the zone of conflict could expand to neighboring regions. 'We are not just fighting for our territory, we are fighting for our freedom and our future,' said a Ukrainian military spokesperson. 'We will not stop until we have achieved our goals and secured our country's sovereignty.' \n",

Ukraine launched a surprise offensive in Kursk last week and has since taken over more than 20 villages and towns. The ISW, which is partially funded by the US defense industry, regularly updates information on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian authorities claim that at least 120,000 people have been evacuated due to the fighting. Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyj stated on Monday that Ukrainian forces have taken over around 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, while Russian authorities claim it is less than half of that. 'It is a significant gain for Ukraine,' said Syrskyj. 'We are making progress and will continue to push forward.' \n",

      "Ukrainian forces have launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, with reports of fierce fights and conflicting accounts of the extent of Kyiv's progress. According to pro-Moscow milbloggers, Ukraine has captured the town of Sudzha and is moving towards Rylsk, while the Institute for the Study of War reported that Ukrainian troops had advanced as much as 6 miles. Acting deputy governor of the Kursk region, Andrei Belostotsky, said Ukrainian troops have 'not advanced a single meter' and were retreating. However, if confirmed, the location of clashes in the villages of Ivnitsa and Anastasyevka up to 26 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with Ukraine would mean that Ukrainian forces have moved about 6 miles on average per day. 'The Armed Forces of Ukraine have launched a up to 25K, or small NATO Corps sized, incursion into the Kursk Oblast that is moving between 7 & 10 km a day,' Trent Telenko posted on X. The operation could draw Russian reserves to the area, potentially weakening Moscow's offensive operations in the Donetsk region, but also risks stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops further along the front line.\n",

The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n",

      "Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a series of cross-border raids into Kursk Oblast on August 6, but Russian milbloggers largely dismissed the claims. Ukrainian officials have largely yet to comment on the raids. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu heavily overexaggerated Russian advances in Ukraine since mid-June 2024, stating that Russian forces have seized 420 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, when in fact ISW has observed evidence confirming that Russian forces have seized approximately 290 square kilometers since June 14. Russian officials continue coordination and military cooperation with Iran ahead of the Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel out of concern for Russian interests in the region. Armenia continues to abstain from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).

      "Based on the provided news, it appears that Ukrainian forces have already made significant advances into Russian territory, particularly in the Kursk Oblast. They have reportedly occupied around 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory and advanced up to 35 kilometers deep into the Kursk region. Given this momentum and the scale of the operation, it's likely that Ukrainian forces will capture Rylsk, Russia before the October 1, 2024 deadline.\n",

      "It's important to note that military situations can change rapidly, and unforeseen developments could alter this timeline. However, based on the current information and trends, the capture of Rylsk by Ukrainian forces before October 1, 2024, seems likely.\n",
      "27219 85 Given the sustained and significant advances by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk Oblast, it is highly probable that Ukrainian-held territory at least five miles inside Russia will remain confined to this oblast by October 1, 2024. The ongoing focus on Kursk Oblast and reports of entrenched positions and strategic gains indicate a high likelihood of continued presence solely in this region.\n",
      "27220 60 While the current focus of Ukrainian advances is predominantly in Kursk Oblast, the possibility of expanding the offensive into adjacent oblasts remains. The logistical and strategic demands of opening another front may lower the probability, but it cannot be fully ruled out, especially if the Kursk offensive achieves its immediate objectives sooner than expected.\n",
      "27221 15 Given the current strategic focus on Kursk Oblast and the scale of the ongoing operation there, it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces will abandon or shift their efforts to exclude Kursk but include at least one other oblast by October 1, 2024. The established foothold in Kursk and ongoing advances suggest a continued focus in this area.\n",
      "27222 10 The significant advances made by Ukrainian forces into Kursk Oblast suggest a continued presence of Ukrainian-controlled territory at least five miles inside Russian borders. While Russian counteroffensives might alter the situation, the probability of Ukraine having no such offensives by October 1, 2024, is very low given current events.\n",
      "27223 75 Ukrainian forces have made significant territorial gains, reaching strategic points and showing a high level of operational capability in Kursk Oblast. Given the ongoing momentum and reports of sustained advances, the capture of Rylsk before October 1, 2024, is likely, although potential Russian countermeasures could still impact the timeline.\n",

      "Australian scientists are preparing for the spread of the deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus to the country's Antarctic territory and sub-Antarctic islands. The virus has already killed millions of birds and mammals worldwide and was detected on the Antarctic Peninsula in February. Scientists are concerned it could spread to the Australian islands as early as this spring. 'It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when' it arrives, said AAD seabird expert Louise Emmerson. A team of experts is wargaming their response to an outbreak on Macquarie Island, which could become reality within months. 'It's really hard to know how grim it's going to be when it arrives,' Emmerson said. The consequences for animals, including seals, penguins, and other seabirds, could be significant, with up to 90% mortality rates in the past. Dr Emmerson and other bird experts will be deployed to the Australian Antarctic Territory to check for signs of the virus and monitor its impact once it arrives. 'We want to keep it that way' - that is, prevent the virus from reaching Australia, said national animal disease preparedness coordinator Dr Brant Smith. 'It's really important we continue to do our surveillance, making sure that we are looking for signs of disease early and responding quickly if we did find an incursion of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] in Australia.' \n",

      "French authorities have detected the first case of highly pathogenic avian flu in a farm since January. The Ministry of Agriculture explained that the confirmed focus was located in a farm with various types of birds in the Ile et Vilaine department in Brittany. The main hypothesis is that the contamination occurred through wild fauna, as indicated by the Agriculture department, which is conducting an epidemiological investigation. The authorities have activated measures to prevent the spread of the disease, including the sacrifice of the farm and its disinfection. A protection zone has been established within a 3-kilometer radius and a surveillance zone within a 10-kilometer radius. The Ministry of Agriculture noted that the detection of this new focus means that France loses its 'indemne' status for highly pathogenic avian flu. To regain this status, 28 days must pass since the end of the cleaning and disinfection operations, provided that no new focus appears. In Portugal, two cases of highly pathogenic avian flu H5N1 have been found in gulls in the districts of Aveiro and Leiria, north of Lisbon. The Portuguese authorities emphasized that there are no poultry farms in those areas. These cases were detected after the DGAV reported the detection of the virus in gulls in various parts of the country. So far, the H5N1 has not been found in poultry in Portugal, said the DGAV, 'The virus is highly pathogenic, and we are taking all necessary measures to prevent its spread.' \n",

      "A highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in dairy cows in the US, causing concern about the potential global health risk. The virus has already infected four dairy workers, but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Experts warn that Europe should be monitoring the virus and preparing to respond quickly if it spreads. The US outbreak is the first time H5N1 has been documented in cattle, making it a higher risk for human transmission. Researchers are concerned about the virus's ability to spread between small animals and its potential to mutate and become more contagious. Some countries, such as Finland, are taking steps to prepare for H5N1, including offering vaccines to high-risk workers and monitoring fur farms. The European Commission is also stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is convening an expert group to support global access to H5N1 vaccines.\n",

      "A new variant of the avian influenza virus, H5N1, has been causing a pandemic in birds, with over 300 million animals dead worldwide. The virus has also been detected in mammals such as minks, seals, and lions in various parts of the world. In April 2024, an outbreak was detected in cattle in the US, which was likely caused by direct transmission between herds without the need for birds. Scientists have found that this was due to mutations in the virus, which now allows it to bind to a receptor present in mammals. This evolution of the pathogen raises the risk of a pandemic to 4 out of 5. The monitoring of this virus failed in the US, where it took several months to detect the outbreak, which has not yet been controlled. The author emphasizes the importance of preparedness and the need for institutions to have the necessary structures to monitor and integrate data from diverse areas such as agriculture, wildlife, and humans. The author also highlights the need for the development of vaccines and the creation of medications to avoid dependence on distribution and price during a pandemic. Additionally, the author stresses the importance of communication with the population and the need to prevent the spread of misinformation. The author concludes by emphasizing the need to act and not just wait for the virus to mutate.\n",

      "A fourth case of avian influenza in humans has been reported in the United States, with the patient having contact with infected dairy cows in Colorado. The patient showed mild symptoms and was treated with an antiviral medication. The H5N1 virus has been circulating among birds for decades and has recently been spreading to other animals, including dairy cows. Researchers are concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can spread quickly through contaminated milk equipment and transportation of infected animals. If the virus were to adapt to humans, it could potentially cause a global pandemic. Experts are working on developing a vaccine and are monitoring the situation closely.\n",

      "A new study has found that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus can transmit from one mammal to another, increasing the risk to humans. The study, conducted by a team from Cornell University, discovered that the virus can transmit directly between cows and from cows to cats and raccoons. According to Diego Diel, professor of virology and director of the Center for Diagnostic Virology at Cornell University, this is one of the first times that effective and sustained transmission of the H5N1 virus from mammal to mammal has been observed. The study's findings are concerning because the virus could potentially adapt to mammals, warns Diel. So far, 11 human cases of avian influenza have been reported in the US, with four linked to the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle and seven to poultry farms. The researchers believe that the virus could have originated from dairy farms in the same county. Although the pathogen can infect humans and replicate in their bodies, the effectiveness of these infections is currently low. The fear is that potential mutations could occur, leading to the virus adapting to mammals, spreading among humans, and potentially transmitting efficiently between humans in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring the pathogen in animals and humans, warns Diel. Measures to contain the spread of the virus include early diagnosis, increased biosafety measures, and quarantines in case of positivity.\n",

      "Since 2019, the world has been facing one of the largest bird flu pandemics, with over 300 million animals killed across all continents. The cause is a new variant of the H5N1 influenza virus, lineage 2.3.4.4b. Normally, avian influenza strains do not infect mammals because the receptor the virus uses to enter bird cells is different, restricting its ability to replicate in other animals. However, since 2023, H5N1 outbreaks have occurred in mammals such as minks, seals, and sea lions in various parts of the world. In April of this year, an epidemic was detected in cattle in the US, which likely started with direct transmission between herds, without the need for birds. Scientists discovered that this happened due to mutations in the virus, which now can bind to a receptor present in mammals. The evolution of the pathogen raises the risk of a pandemic to 4, on a scale of 5. Two major influenza pandemics of avian origin occurred in 1957 and 1968, and in both cases, the ability acquired by the virus to bind to mammalian receptors was fundamental for this to occur. The monitoring of this virus failed in the US, where it took several months to detect the outbreak, which has not yet been controlled. We learned from COVID-19 what happens when a virus circulates without control: mutations are acquired, giving the pathogen increased transmissibility, escape from the immune response, and the ability to infect new species. It is essential to remember that the influenza virus generates a number of mutations per replication cycle much greater than SARS-CoV-2. It is still difficult to predict how this situation may evolve. Rich countries have already begun to organize and buy vaccines for H5N1. Finland, for example, is considering vaccinating people who care for animals. In Brazil, are our institutions equipped with the necessary structures to monitor and integrate data from such diverse areas as agriculture, wild animals, and humans? Do we already have the vaccine in production? Have research funding agencies organized scientists to respond to this new problem? Ester Sabino asks these questions, highlighting the importance of cooperation between researchers and health authorities. She also points out that the Butantan Institute already has the necessary technology to produce vaccines against H5N1 and that Brazil needs to develop the capacity to create medicines, avoiding dependence on distribution and price during a pandemic. \n",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first case of mammal-to-human transmission of the bird flu virus, H5N1, in the US. A dairy worker in Texas contracted the virus from a cow in March, marking the first recorded instance of this type of transmission globally. Since then, four more dairy workers and six poultry workers have tested positive for the virus, with a seventh case still under investigation. Although the cases have been mild, health authorities are increasing surveillance efforts and stockpiling vaccines due to concerns over the potential for a new human pandemic. Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the UK Health Security Agency, stated, 'The recent outbreak in US dairy cattle demonstrates that influenza A(H5N1) continues to infect new mammals and spread between them.' She added, 'UKHSA will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to initiate an appropriate public health response should it be needed.' \n",

      "Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.\n",

      "A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.\n",

      "A study published in the journal Nature found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can be transmitted between mammals through contaminated cow's milk and can reach the mammary glands. The study, led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, isolated the virus from milk of an infected cow in New Mexico, USA, and demonstrated that it can replicate and cause disease in mice and ferrets, two common animal models for studying influenza in mammals. The detection of a subtype of the virus in a dairy farm in the United States in the spring of 2024 is the first documented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle. Since then, it has been documented to spread between herds and infect other mammals, including humans, indicating a 'greater risk' to public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been four recent cases in humans - workers - in the United States. While the current risk to public health is low, the CDC is monitoring the situation 'closely' and working with the 12 affected states. The study characterized the isolated virus and demonstrated that it can transmit through milk from infected cows to mice and ferrets, and even to the mammary glands of infected animals. The virus was also found to transmit from infected mice to their offspring. Aitor Nogales González, a scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, summarized that the study showed that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that there is vertical transmission in infected mice. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently through respiratory transmission in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past. However, they suggest that the virus isolated in the outbreak in cattle may have characteristics that facilitate infection and transmission in mammals, including humans. This conclusion is mainly due to the virus's ability to bind to cellular receptors present in the upper respiratory tract of humans, according to the Science Media Centre (SMC) Spain. 'Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain alert. We must remember that the last pandemics of influenza have had the avian influenza as a fundamental actor', concludes Nogales. The new study aims to answer key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes. \n",

      "Nine human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the US, with four recent cases in Colorado. The cases are a result of a global outbreak of H5N1, a particular strain of avian influenza that originated in 2020. The cases in the US have been relatively mild and have only affected agricultural workers who had contact with infected animals. Some patients have presented typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or runny nose. Several have also had conjunctivitis or pink eyes. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, said that the current strain of the virus is not well adapted for human infection and may not even be well adapted for lower respiratory tract infection. The cases are derived from a global outbreak of H5N1, which has affected poultry farms and dairy farms in the US. The first human case in the country was reported in April 2022, followed by cases in Texas, Michigan, and Colorado. The mild nature of the cases contrasts with the effect of the virus on birds and some mammals, such as seals, lions, foxes, raccoons, and cats, which have died from the virus. Since January 2022, over 99 million wild waterfowl, commercial poultry, and backyard poultry in the US have been affected, meaning they died from the virus or were slaughtered to prevent further transmission. Approximately 160 dairy cow herds have also been affected since the virus was first detected in cows in March. This H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, meaning it has a high potential to kill chickens. 'It's scary to hear about a virus like this, but that term is actually a USDA term referring to what happens in poultry,' said John Lednicky, professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. 'The fact that it's highly pathogenic in birds does not mean it is in humans or mammals.' Lednicky added that some H5N1 strains are fatal in humans, while others are not. Of the over 900 cases of H5N1 in people reported worldwide since 1997, approximately half were fatal. However, in the last two years, the global mortality rate has been lower: around 27%. Even then, those figures reflect mainly people who were sick enough to seek treatment. Dr. Peter Palese, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said that the patients included in that count are those who 'have been hospitalized and, in retrospect, have been in contact with large quantities of virus.' Palese's 2012 research, which examined blood samples from 12,500 people without a documented flu infection, found that between 1% and 2% of them may have been previously infected with H5N1. However, experts still fear that the virus could mutate into a version that causes a more severe disease or spreads from person to person (so far, all transmission has been from animals to humans). 'The concern is that as more animals and people get infected, the virus will change,' said Binnicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched a $5 million initiative to provide seasonal flu vaccines to livestock workers to prevent the emergence of a supercharged virus. According to Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, 'preventing seasonal influenza in these workers may also reduce the risk of new versions of the influenza A virus emerging.' The risk of genetic reassortment, where multiple viruses co-infect the same cell and replicate to create a new virus, is 'theoretical,' but 'because we know that it could happen, we want to take steps now to reduce that effect.' The CDC is partnering with community-based organizations to provide training and information sessions about bird flu and expand access to testing, treatment, and PPE. There have been nine known human cases of H5N1 among poultry workers in Colorado, but symptoms have been mild and the prevalence is still 'extremely low.' The general public's risk of getting sick with bird flu remains low, but there is still a real risk for animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans is compromised by irregular surveillance. The WHO reported that the United States has notified a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influenza due to contact with infected dairy cows, and Cambodia has reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. 'At this moment, there has been no reported transmission between humans, so the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low', said the head of the UN health agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'However, our ability to assess and manage this risk is compromised by limited surveillance of animal viruses worldwide', he added in a press conference. 'Understanding how these viruses spread and mutate in animals is essential to identify any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the possibility of a pandemic', he emphasized. The WHO appealed to all countries to intensify surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, along with an increase in the number of infected mammals. The virus has caused the death of tens of millions of birds, as well as infecting wild birds and terrestrial and marine mammals. Human cases registered in Europe and the United States since the virus outbreak have been mostly brief. H5N1 has spread among dairy cow herds in the United States, now with four cases of the disease passing from cattle to humans.\n",

The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the risk of avian influenza to human health as low globally. According to a document released on Wednesday, the organization also classifies the risk of infection for farm workers and similar establishments as 'low to moderate', depending on the risk mitigation measures in place. The WHO states that the transmission of the virus between animals continues to occur, and there have been only a 'limited number' of human infections reported. 'Although new human infections associated with exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments will likely continue to occur, the impact of such infections on public health at the global level is minimal.' In June, the WHO confirmed the first death from the H5N2 variant of avian influenza. The patient, a 59-year-old man from Mexico, had no history of exposure to birds or other animals. The organization emphasized that the patient had multiple underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for three weeks before showing symptoms. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned in July that the organization's ability to evaluate and manage the risk of avian influenza to human health was 'compromised' due to failures in animal case surveillance worldwide. 'Last week, the United States reported the fourth case of the H5N1 virus in a human after exposure to infected dairy cows. Cambodia also reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. To date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported, and therefore, the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low,' he explained. 'However, our ability to evaluate and manage this risk is compromised due to limited surveillance of animal influenza cases worldwide. Understanding how the virus spreads and reproduces in animals is essential to identifying any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans or the potential for a pandemic,' he added. In a press conference, the WHO Director-General appealed for all countries to strengthen their systems for surveillance and notification of avian influenza cases in animals and humans. Tedros also requested that countries share samples and sequences of the H5N1 virus with WHO collaborating centers worldwide, maintaining public access to the data.\n",

Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.\n",

      "Denver Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton has praised rookie quarterback Bo Nix after his preseason debut, saying he 'handled it very well' and showed 'a lot of poise and control'. Sutton, who has seen many quarterbacks in his six-year career, believes Nix has the potential to be a leader and take the team to the playoffs. The coaching staff has left Sutton and Nix to work together, and Nix is expected to start in the next game against the Green Bay Packers. Meanwhile, Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson may see reduced playing time, with Stidham potentially getting more opportunities in the preseason finale against the Arizona Cardinals. Sutton is excited to work with Nix and believes he has the 'leader mentality' and 'aura' to carry the team to success.\n",

      "Rookie quarterback Bo Nix made a strong impression in his first NFL game, leading the Denver Broncos to a 34-30 preseason win over the Indianapolis Colts. Nix completed 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown, with a passer rating of 102.3. He took over for starter Jarrett Stidham and led the Broncos to their first 20 points and a 20-10 lead. Nix will start next Sunday's second preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, and another strong showing could earn him the nod for the Sept. 8 opener at Seattle. Broncos coach Sean Payton was 'pleased' with Nix's play and said Stidham got a 'tough break' with an interception and penalties. Payton also praised Nix's composure, saying 'he felt pretty good' and that the team executed well when Nix was in the game. 'When we executed well, guys were in the right spots, and we moved the ball efficiently a lot of the day, and that usually turns into points,' Nix said. 'It was a nice play by (Marvin Mims Jr.),' Nix said of his touchdown pass. 'He did a good job of getting to the corner, and we executed well. We've been practicing and repping that play quite a lot.' Mims was impressed by Nix's confidence, saying 'his confidence is really radiant.' Sutton also liked what he saw from Nix, saying 'he looked good out there. I was excited to see him handling the two-minute drill,' Sutton said of Nix leading the Broncos down the field for a 27-yard field by Lutz with 5 seconds left in the half. 'He made some really good reads. He got the ball where it needed to be.' \n",

      "The Denver Broncos' quarterback battle is underway, with three potential starters vying for the starting job. According to DraftKings' odds, Bo Nix is the betting favorite to start Week 1, followed by Zach Wilson and Jarrett Stidham. Nix, a former Heisman candidate, has the most potential but will need to earn the job in training camp. Wilson, who was part of a dysfunctional New York Jets offense, will need to have an out-of-this-world preseason to get the starting job. Stidham, with the most NFL experience, will have to blow the competition out of the water to lock in the starting role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton is cautiously approaching the decision to name his starting quarterback, but the evidence suggests that rookie passer Bo Nix is a strong contender. Veteran teammates, including Audric Estime, Tim Patrick, Courtland Sutton, and Mike McGlinchey, have praised Nix's performance in training camp, noting his ability to take command of the huddle and make plays. Estime said, 'He's a really good guy, he's a game manager, he's a guy that played a lot of football in his career, so, he knows what he's doing.' McGlinchey added, 'He played his balls off out there, and I'm just proud of him and excited to see where he can go.' With Nix's impressive performance in his pro debut and his ability to handle pressure, it seems likely that Payton will anoint him as the starter if he continues on his current trajectory.\n",

      "Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix had a solid passing performance in the preseason, throwing for 125 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. However, his rushing performance was also notable, with three carries for 17 yards, showcasing his mobility and ability to extend plays. When asked about his confidence in his ability to make plays with his legs, Nix said, 'Very confident. I train for that, and I make sure that I work to keep some of that.' Broncos coach Sean Payton has designed running plays for Nix, who rushed 143 times for 744 yards and 20 touchdowns in two seasons at Oregon.\n",

      "Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is expected to start in Week 1, with all reviews and team thoughts being positive. Coach Sean Payton has defended the team's decision to take Nix at No. 12 overall, and many believe he will win the starting job. However, factors such as the team's competitiveness and potential losses may influence the decision. Payton is eager to see Nix in action, and unless Jarrett Stidham or Zach Wilson have an exceptional training camp, Nix is likely to be the starting quarterback.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denver Broncos are entering training camp with a quarterback battle between three players: Zach Wilson, Jarrett Stidham, and Bo Nix. Wilson, the underdog, faces the toughest odds of becoming the starting quarterback due to his time with the New York Jets, where he threw 23 touchdowns to 25 interceptions. Stidham, who has spent a year in Sean Payton's system, may have a slight advantage, but he still needs to prove he can lead the team. Nix, the 12th overall pick, brings unique skills, including exceptional processing, timing, and accuracy, and is a strong contender to take the starting job. The Broncos' most crucial camp battle will be for the starting quarterback spot, with Nix and Stidham likely to be the top contenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denver Broncos' quarterback competition will intensify this week with the arrival of the Green Bay Packers. Jarrett Stidham started the preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts, but played only two drives due to penalties and a turnover. Bo Nix impressed in his limited time, but played against mostly backup defenders. Zach Wilson was efficient in mop-up duties, going 10-of-13 passing for 117 yards. Broncos coach Sean Payton praised all three quarterbacks, saying 'All three of those guys I thought did a good job.' Nix is set to start against the Packers in Week 2 of preseason, where he will face Green Bay's starters in a joint practice on Friday. This week's evaluation will be crucial in determining the starting quarterback, with Payton noting that 'these [preseason] games and then the scrimmages' are key in the evaluation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denver Broncos are set to compete for the starting quarterback job between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. According to The Athletic's Nick Kosmider, Bo Nix is the favorite to start, as he has shown no signs of being outplayed by the other quarterbacks in camp. Nix, a 24-year-old rookie, has a strong chance of starting due to his ability to excel in head coach Sean Payton's system, which emphasizes the quick game, run game, and deep shots. If Nix emerges as the answer, it would be ideal for the Broncos, who have missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons since Peyton Manning's retirement in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denver Broncos' starting quarterback battle has narrowed down to Jarrett Stidham and rookie Bo Nix, according to ESPN. Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson, who was traded to the Broncos in April, is now on the outside looking in. Broncos coach Sean Payton acknowledged that the competition is down to two, with Stidham working with the starters the most this week. The Broncos traded a sixth-round pick to the New York Jets for Wilson and a seventh-round pick, but it's now unclear if they will keep him on the 53-man roster. Wilson's past behavior, including alienating teammates and coaches, has raised concerns about his fit with the team. 'It's not etched in stone, we talk about it at the beginning of the week,' Payton said. 'It's hard to rotate three with the first group... We'll see how Saturday goes... not going to be a scrimmage, but it's going to be like three phases, like move the ball.' \n",

      "Denver Broncos quarterback Zach Wilson's future with the team may be more secure than initially thought. After completing 10-of-13 passes for 117 yards in the Broncos' 34-30 win over the Indianapolis Colts, Broncos insider Nick Kosmider suggested that Wilson, along with rookie Bo Nix and journeyman Jarrett Stidham, will make the team's Week 1 roster. Broncos reporter Parker Gabriel echoed Kosmider's take, saying that Wilson 'looks more like a project worth investing in' despite his volatility in practices. While Wilson has struggled in his first three NFL seasons with the New York Jets, he is still just 25 years old and has shown promise at times. As of Tuesday afternoon, DraftKings Sportsbook listed Nix as the betting favorite to start over Stidham and Wilson for the Broncos' Week 1 game against the Seattle Seahawks. However, it appears that head coach Sean Payton may give Wilson plenty of chances to impress during the upcoming exhibition matchup against the Green Bay Packers.\n",

      "The Denver Broncos' quarterback competition is heating up at training camp, with head coach Sean Payton pleased with the consistent rotation of players. First-round pick Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson are all vying for the starting position. Nix emphasized the importance of learning from each play, while Stidham highlighted the value of competition in the NFL. Wilson, who is looking for a fresh start after a tumultuous tenure with the New York Jets, is focused on correcting his mistakes and improving with each practice. The team will take a day off on Sunday to evaluate practice film and plan for next week's workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix showed promise in his preseason debut, navigating the Indianapolis pass rush and extending plays. Nix's ability to work around pressure is attributed to his mindset and athleticism. Coach Sean Payton praised Nix's timing and tempo, saying 'Yeah, listen, ball (is) out.' The Broncos' coaching staff is not concerned with Nix's stumbles, but rather his response to new information. Quarterbacks coach Davis Webb emphasized the importance of not handcuffing quarterbacks and allowing them to develop their own style. Meanwhile, quarterback Zach Wilson has shown growth in training camp, demonstrating poise under pressure and a calm demeanor. Wilson's performance in Sunday's game, where he went 10-of-13 for 117 yards, has raised questions about whether he can compete for a spot in Denver's quarterbacks room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denver Broncos have released their unofficial depth chart, listing veteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham as the starter. However, rookie first-round pick Bo Nix is listed as the third quarterback, behind former New York Jets QB Zach Wilson. Broncos insider Klis noted that Stidham earned the No. 1 listing due to his performance in OTAs and training camp. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport stated that Nix has impressed in Denver and could potentially start in Week 1. Nix has taken first-team reps in back-to-back practices and has a strong chance of starting sooner rather than later. 'Right now... Jarrett Stidham is the QB1 on the official unofficial depth chart,' Rapoport said. 'But I still wouldn't be surprised if Bo Nix ended up as the starter for Week 1.' \n",

      "Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is competing with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting quarterback job. Nix wants to make sure he gives coach Sean Payton every reason to pick him for the job. He said, 'I'm going to do my best to get ready.' The Broncos open the regular season on September 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Nix, Stidham, and Wilson are splitting the work with the starters equally this week, with Nix expected to be with the starters for most of Monday's practice.

      "The Denver Broncos will start rookie quarterback Bo Nix in their next preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Aug. 18, as announced by coach Sean Payton last Friday. Nix impressed in his NFL debut against the Indianapolis Colts, completing 15 of 21 passing attempts for 125 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. However, the Broncos might face a second-string defense from the Packers, as coach Matt LaFleur said most starters won't play in Denver in Week 2 of preseason. Fortunately, the Packers will feature their defensive starters in a scrimmage-like joint practice with Denver on Friday, giving Nix some live-game reps against the first-team defense.\n",

      "Denver Broncos' quarterback Bo Nix is the presumptive starting quarterback for Week 1 against the Seahawks. Nix performed well in the preseason debut, leading four scoring drives and completing 15-of-21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. In contrast, Jarrett Stidham struggled, going 4-for-7 passing for 37 yards and an interception. Broncos' offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi praised Nix's ability to execute on offense, saying, 'When you give him a play, and it's new and the defense has a new install, there's a little bit of a — not as much confidence when he gets it and you look in his eyes... After a couple of days when you're running the same plays, you just feel like he's a veteran.' Nix has 61 college starts, the most of any rookie quarterback in the NFL.\n",

Contract negotiations for wide receivers CeeDee Lamb and Brandon Aiyuk are ongoing, with Lamb's situation potentially being resolved soon, while Aiyuk may prefer to stay with the San Francisco 49ers over joining the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. has assured the military that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will definitely need more planes to address ongoing security concerns. Teodoro reaffirmed the Department of National Defense's (DND) commitment to strengthening the country's air defense systems, particularly through the acquisition of multi-role fighters. This comes after two Chinese fighter jets dropped flares on the flight path of a PAF aircraft conducting patrol operations in the airspace above Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. The AFP denounced the illegal and dangerous actions of the two Chinese aircraft, which were done within the airspace of the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has already filed a diplomatic protest. Teodoro welcomed and honored the PAF contingent for their successful participation in Exercise Pitch Black 2024 in Australia, emphasizing the crucial collaboration across the Philippine government that enabled the deployment. He urged regular joint and combined exercises with like-minded partners, saying 'And now, the challenge for you is we need to sustain these kinds of operations. We have to make this the new normal.

The four-nation maneuvers aim to demonstrate regional strength and international cooperation, and emphasize the lawful uses of the sea and international airspace. China's actions have been met with concerns of a potential conflict, as it has been saber-rattling toward Taiwan and the South China Sea. The Philippines has held separate naval exercises in the South China Sea, and a joint coast guard exercise is scheduled off Manila Bay on Friday between the Philippines and Vietnam. The Philippines has a mutual defense treaty with the United States and signed a treaty with Japan last month. 'The naval and air force units of participating nations will operate together, enhancing cooperation and interoperability between our armed forces,' said the joint statement.

Teodoro expects these agreements to be signed by 2025, aiming to increase the 'interoperability' of armed forces between countries. The agreements will allow the armed forces of these countries to operate together with the Philippine Army in the Philippines and vice versa. Teodoro emphasized that these agreements are not a mutual defense treaty, but a step forward in military ties. The Philippines has agreements with Australia and the UK, and a mutual defense treaty with the US. Tensions between the Philippines and China have increased since the rise of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2022, who has strengthened military ties with the US and expanded access to its bases for US troops, including some in the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan.

      "Japan and the Philippines signed a defense agreement to focus on China's growing military power in the region. The agreement allows for the deployment of troops on each other's soil, amid shared concerns about China's military expansion. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kishida and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed the agreement on Monday during a ceremony in Manila. The agreement enables Japanese troops to deploy in the Philippines for joint military exercises, and Philippine troops to conduct combat training in Japan. The agreement requires ratification by the legislative bodies of both countries to take effect. The agreement comes as Japan and the Philippines, both US allies, express concern over China's growing influence in the region. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and four other Southeast Asian countries. In 2016, an international court in The Hague ruled that China's claims had no legal basis. The Chinese and Philippine coast guards and navies have been involved in several confrontations in disputed waters, including a recent incident where Chinese coast guards used knives and harpoons and rammed two Philippine Navy supply ships. Japan has a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa. Under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Tokyo has sought to strengthen its military power, including through reciprocal access agreements with Australia and the UK. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. strongly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and warned that his country would consider any Filipino killed by China as a 'war crime'. Manila has long-standing defense agreements with Australia and the US, and is exploring a similar agreement with France. In April, leaders of the US, Japan, and the Philippines held their first trilateral summit in Washington, as part of efforts to strengthen military cooperation between the three countries.

The command has significant assets in Alaska, Guam, Japan, and the Philippines, including airbases, naval bases, and special operations forces.

'Their increasing interaction is causing significant concerns in Washington,' the article states. Earlier, US lawmakers had warned that the US cannot compete with China and Russia and would likely lose in a war against them.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown is 'fully confident' that the US would defeat China if war were to break out over Taiwan, despite the Commission on National Defense Strategy predicting extreme losses on the US side. However, Russell argues that war would result in mass loss of life, economic devastation, environmental destruction, and human rights atrocities. The US has been in near constant conflict since its inception, and recent wars have shown ineptitude, with widespread death and destruction. The government is edging towards war with China, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin bringing $500 million to the Philippines to boost their military capabilities and Secretary of State Antony Blinken negotiating a deal to move US operational control of Japanese forces from Hawaii to Japan. Russell emphasizes that this is not just about war strategy, but also about public perception, as the American people are more likely to support a war when they aren't losing loved ones. She also criticizes the US government's use of proxy states and funding the troops of another country as long as they act in US interests, which she calls a 'dark feeling of indifference towards the citizens of other nations.' Russell concludes that it's time for the American public to take a stand against the normalization of conflict and the preparation for war with China, which she calls 'global suicide.'\n",

      "The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.\n",

The US has held secret military exercises with Taiwan in Michigan, with 7,000 Taiwanese troops stationed in the Midwest. The US National Guard has been involved in the training, similar to its involvement in training Ukrainian forces since 2014. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea are set to hold joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and Japan is increasing its military budget to purchase US missiles and fighter jets. Taiwan is also preparing for a potential conflict, building 220 naval medical services and holding exercises at its largest airport to repel a Chinese landing. Anti-China hawks in the US are already preparing for a conflict, and China is also preparing, concentrating its naval forces around Taiwan and deploying hypersonic missiles. The upcoming January elections in Taiwan could be a turning point, with the ruling party's candidate potentially pushing for independence and secession.\n",

In an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on the Middle East situation, Fu Kong described the US as 'the largest supplier of arms to Israel' and urged it to 'take sincere and responsible steps' on this issue. He condemned the Israeli attack on the 'Al-Taff' school in Gaza and emphasized the need to avoid targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. Fu Kong also stressed the need for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, saying, 'Repeatedly attacking schools where many civilians are seeking refuge is a disturbing matter.' The attack on the Al-Taff school on Saturday killed over 100 people and injured dozens, with many taking refuge there from Israeli military operations. The US has been supporting Israel since October 7, 2023, in a devastating war on Gaza that has left over 132,000 Palestinian dead and injured, mostly children and women, and over 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine.\n",

He also stated that US President Joe Biden has a few months left to remove any ambiguity in the US' policy on Taiwan, and that China's anti-access/area denial strategy must be countered.

Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. has assured the military that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will definitely need more planes to address ongoing security concerns. Teodoro reaffirmed the Department of National Defense's (DND) commitment to strengthening the country's air defense systems, particularly through the acquisition of multi-role fighters. This comes after two Chinese fighter jets dropped flares on the flight path of a PAF aircraft conducting patrol operations in the airspace above Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal.

      "The Philippines and China are engaged in a complex and fluid dispute over the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines has been resupplying its troops on the shoal without prior notification to China, which has led to tensions between the two countries. China has insisted that the Philippines must receive prior approval from Beijing for troop rotation and reprovisioning, which Manila has rejected. The dispute has a long history, dating back to 1998 when the Philippines deliberately sunk a ship to prevent China's expansionist territorial ambitions. The Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and laser lights against their vessels, and a Chinese coastguard rammed a Filipino navy boat in June 2024, injuring a soldier. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Second Thomas Shoal is an underwater feature that cannot be occupied without a structure above it, and the sunken ship provides the necessary platform for Filipino soldiers to stay afloat. The dispute is not just about humanitarian considerations, but also about ownership of the feature and competing strategic designs in the South China Sea. The spat over reprovisioning goes beyond the Second Thomas Shoal and is ingrained in the foreign policy motivations of both countries, making it difficult to reconcile their political differences. The situation is unlikely to be resolved soon if both sides continue to bicker and disagree with each other. A multifaceted approach that emphasizes diplomacy, adherence to international law, and trust-building measures is needed to manage their disagreements and work towards a peaceful and stable resolution.\n",

The Philippine military also condemned the incident, with General Romeo Brawner Jr. saying that the Chinese actions could have led to 'catastrophic consequences.'

Lin emphasized that Huangyan Dao has always been Chinese territory, and China has undisputed sovereignty over Huangyan Dao and its adjacent airspace and waters. He noted that Philippine military aircraft twice invaded the adjacent airspace of Huangyan Dao on August 7 and 8, seriously infringing on China's sovereignty and violating international law and basic norms governing international relations. The Chinese military took necessary and lawful measures in response, and their actions in the area were professional and consistent with Chinese law and international law, Lin said.

      "The Philippines has reacted correctly to China's aggression in the West Philippine Sea. China recently deployed two air force jets that engaged in dangerous maneuvers near a Philippine Air Force plane, dropping eight flares in its path. The incident was meant to intimidate Filipino forces and assert China's sovereignty over the shoal. Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said that the Philippines will file a diplomatic protest against China. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro stated that the incident cannot go unanswered, as it would be akin to acquiescence. President Marcos strongly condemned the incident, describing it as unjustified, illegal, and reckless. The Philippines will continue to take the diplomatic route, as it has proven to be an effective way to counter China's aggression. According to retired Brigadier General Manuel Oxales, 'A good commander will not go head-to-head in battle unless he has lethal and number superiority in weapons and arms, with the right timing and situations to his advantage and favor.' The Philippines has filed 405 diplomatic protests against China, including 130 during the Marcos regime. These protests have hurt China more than realized, as they have caused numerous countries to condemn China's actions and revealed the country's true nature as a 'pariah state.' The Philippines' diplomatic protests have also led to a loss of confidence in the Chinese leadership, resulting in grave economic consequences, including capital flight and a decline in multilateral agreements. The Philippines' actions have maintained its moral high ground and proved that it behaves in accordance with international laws, resulting in an increasing number of like-minded countries aligning with it for defense and economic cooperation.\n",

      "The Philippines has adopted a more assertive stance in the South China Sea dispute, challenging China's maritime claims by increasing transparency and strengthening its military alliance with the United States. This move was triggered by a February 2023 decision to release photos of a military-grade laser directed at a Filipino ship, as reported by National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya. The transparency campaign, led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, aims to build international support by documenting encounters with Chinese forces and incorporating foreign journalists in coast guard missions. The Philippines' efforts have included releasing images showing aggressive actions by Chinese vessels, such as water cannon use against Filipino ships. The intensification of the disputes has been marked by incidents near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippine Navy maintains a presence on the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Recent confrontations have increased, with the Philippine Coast Guard reporting a surge in Chinese vessels from an average of one in 2021 to approximately 14 in 2023, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The conflict has drawn international attention, with statements of support from various countries and a renewed defense agreement with the US, providing access to additional military bases in the Philippines. This has raised concerns about possible US involvement under the mutual defense treaty in case the situation escalates. Although the Philippines has gained diplomatic support, they remain cautious about possible Chinese economic retaliation, their second-largest export market in 2023. The recent political approach also risks provoking China to adopt a 'tougher approach', according to political scientist Edcel John Ibarra. However, Philippine Ambassador to Washington José Manuel Romualdez expressed hope to maintain economic relations alongside efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully. This assertive stance by the Philippines has surprised neighboring countries with similar maritime disputes, signaling a potential new approach to dealing with tensions with Beijing.

The break-up was evident when Duterte-Carpio did not attend President Marcos' State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 22. The feud between the two powerful families has been escalating for months, with both sides accusing each other of being a drug user. The tensions have led to a series of events, including the release of a deepfake video purporting to show Marcos doing drugs, and the recall of 75 officers assigned to Duterte-Carpio's security detail. The vice-president has publicly pleaded for more security to protect her family, citing a photo surreptitiously taken of them at Manila's airport as an example of the threats they face. The government has also announced that it will not get in the way of the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the Duterte administration's bloody war on drugs. Observers say that the administration will have to double down on two of its most popular stances to win over public opinion: confronting Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea and banning Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (Pogos). However, the narrative the Marcos administration is building on these issues may not be enough to win over public opinion, as the Dutertes are known to be masters of courting public opinion. The break-up of the UniTeam alliance has significant implications for the country's future, as both families are now attempting to strengthen their own political coalitions ahead of the 2025 midterm elections.

      "The 2024 Democratic National Convention will take place from August 19-22 at the United Center and McCormick Place in Chicago. Kamala Harris will be officially nominated as the Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, and Tim Walz will be endorsed as the party's nominee for Vice President. The event is expected to draw a crowd of nearly 100,000 and will be broadcast live on various networks and cable channels, including ABC, CBS, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox, NBC, MSNBC, and PBS. According to pollsters, the DNC event will be crucial in boosting Harris' approval ratings after Biden's exit, which has been costly for the Democrats. As Harris said, 'The stage I get on this day will go a long way in deciding my strength in the key swing states and other regions of the United States.' \n",

      "President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement. This has led to the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot. A brokered convention has not occurred in 70 years, and could lead to a chaotic nominating process. The last time a brokered convention happened was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated on the third ballot. Experts say that a brokered convention would be unpredictable and could lead to a candidate who is less likely to win the White House. However, some argue that a brokered convention could benefit the Democrats if their opponent is Donald Trump, who has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University. 'Because Donald Trump is so singularly unpopular as the opposing party nominee, it potentially does give the Democratic Party a small advantage,' he added.\n",

      "The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is set to stream the 2024 convention on multiple digital media platforms, including TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, and more, in an effort to attract younger viewers. According to DNCC Executive Director Alex Hornbrook, 'The convention team set out with an ambitious goal of reaching more Americans than ever before, and today's announcement is yet another milestone in our mission to broadcast Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz's story to all Americans.' The convention will also be covered by leading cable news networks, including Fox, CNN, MSNBC, and NewsNation. This move comes as major media companies invest in streaming for their news, sports, and entertainment offerings, with studies showing younger media consumers are more likely to subscribe to a streaming service and get news content from social or digital platforms.\n",

      "As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.\n",

      "US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not run for re-election in the 2024 presidential election. This means that the Democratic Party needs to find a new presidential candidate or candidate. The party will hold a convention in August to nominate a new candidate. The convention is expected to be an 'open convention', where delegates are free to vote for any candidate they choose. The party will try to find a candidate who can unite the party and motivate voters across the ideological spectrum. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the convention will become a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and candidates will try to negotiate and form alliances to win over delegates.\n",

The party's primary election process will take place in August, where delegates will vote to choose the party's nominee. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the convention will move to a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and delegates will negotiate to find a compromise candidate. The process is similar to the one depicted in popular American TV shows such as 'West Wing' and 'House of Cards'. The last brokered convention was held in 1952. The Democratic Party's national committee and superdelegates will also play a crucial role in the process, as they can vote in the second round of voting. The new candidate will be chosen by the end of August and will represent the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election.\n",

      "President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election has raised questions about the implications of his decision. However, there are precedents for an incumbent president or candidate to withdraw from a presidential race. In 1972, Thomas Eagleton withdrew from the Democratic ticket after revelations about his past, and in 1968, Lyndon Johnson withdrew from his campaign for a second term. The Democratic Party has chosen its presidential candidates through its own processes, and the parties choose their nominees for President and Vice President by their own rules. The Democratic National Convention held a virtual roll call vote to choose its presidential nominees, and Vice President Kamala Harris became the nominee. The campaign finance implications of President Biden's withdrawal are also being considered, with Vice President Harris having access to the funds of the Biden-Harris campaign committee. In the end, the integrity of the presidential election will be ensured through the existing processes and precedents.\n",

According to the WHO, nearly 4% of cases of the current strain, called clade 1b, are deadly, compared to less than 1% of the 2022 subtype. Children are particularly affected by 1b, accounting for 62% of mpox deaths in Congo. The CDC notes that less than a quarter of those most at risk for mpox in the U.S. have had both doses of the Jynneos mpox vaccine, which is effective for both clade 1 and clade 2 of mpox. 'I'm a lot more concerned for the people in African countries where those vaccines are not available,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africa CDC has declared Mpox as a 'public health emergency of continental concern'. According to Africa CDC president Jean Kasenya, 'This declaration is not a mere formality, it's a clear call to action. It's a recognition that we can no longer afford to be reactive. We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this scourge.' The declaration will allow for the release of funds for vaccine access and a coordinated continental response. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for the disease. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans and also through close physical contact with an infected person. Since January 2022, 38,465 cases have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is more deadly and contagious than previous strains. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains caused localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype, mainly limited to western and central African countries, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had declared the highest level of alert in July 2022, but lifted it less than a year later in May 2023, after the outbreak had resulted in around 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.' 'Despite a safe and effective vaccine and antiviral treatment against mpox, these are not readily available to most [African Union member states],' wrote Africa CDC in a report on July 30, 2024. 'Thus, we have listed the risk level as high.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A new, more transmissible strain of the mpox virus, known as clade Ib, is driving a surging outbreak in Africa, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has caused 208 deaths and over 99,000 cases across 116 countries since 2022, with the majority of recent cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new strain has been detected in other African nations, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, and has been spreading through both sexual and non-sexual contact. According to the World Health Organisation, clade Ib causes death in around 3.6% of cases, with infants and children being more at risk. The Africa CDC has secured an agreement to supply 200,000 vaccine doses across the continent, but acknowledges that this will not be enough to control the outbreak. 'If Africa had received the necessary vaccine doses and support earlier, then case numbers would not be so high now,' said Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an alert for doctors to watch for signs of a more severe strain of mpox, called clade 1, which is spreading in parts of Africa. The strain has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa, but the CDC is recommending clinicians in the U.S. consider mpox in patients who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries and have symptoms of mpox. According to the World Health Organization, most reported cases in known endemic provinces are among children under 15 years of age, and infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death. The available mpox vaccine, from drugmaker Jynneos, is effective for both clade 1 and clade 2 of mpox, according to the CDC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to US doctors to be on the lookout for a more severe strain of mpox, known as the clade 1 strain, which is spreading in parts of Africa. The strain has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa, but the CDC is concerned about the likelihood of additional spread. According to the CDC, the risk of clade I mpox importation to the United States is considered to be very low due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries. However, mpox cases have soared by 160% in Africa this year, with 14,250 cases reported so far. The majority of cases and deaths have been in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where nearly 70% of cases have been in children under the age of 15. Doctors Without Borders have called the outbreak 'worrying' and are pleading for vaccines to arrive in the country as soon as possible. The CDC has recommended that doctors consider this more dangerous strain of mpox in patients who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries. Mpox symptoms can include rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, muscle aches, and respiratory symptoms. A study is being conducted to see if giving people an mpox shot after exposure can help prevent severe illness and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africa CDC has declared the mpox outbreak a 'public health emergency' on the continent. With its highest level of alert, the agency has issued a 'clear call to action' to curb its spread. 'Mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands of people across our continent (...) I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox as a continental public health emergency,' said Africa CDC President Jean Kasenya at a press conference. According to Africa CDC data, there have been 38,465 cases of the disease, formerly known as monkeypox, in 16 African countries since January 2022, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of July 28, 2024, there have been 14,250 cases of mpox (2,745 confirmed; 11,505 suspected) and 456 deaths in 10 African countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounts for over 90% of severe mpox clade 1b cases. The DRC has identified 13,791 cases, with children under 15 accounting for 68% of cases and 85% of deaths. Four countries - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda - have reported cases since mid-July 2024. The Africa CDC recognizes the need for a continental strategic framework to strengthen cross-border surveillance, coordination, and information sharing among African Union member states. The WHO and Africa CDC provide financial and technical assistance for epidemic and pandemic response, but the disparity in access to resources between high-income and low-income countries remains stark. The AU has approved $10.4-million from Covid funds for the mpox response, and the WHO has issued an invitation for manufacturers of mpox vaccines to submit an expression of interest for emergency use listing. The Africa CDC plans to meet with the AU to seek their backing for declaring a public health emergency of continental concern.\n",

      "Based on the provided news, there are several factors suggesting that the CDC is likely to confirm a case of Clade I mpox in a US resident before August 23, 2024:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The outbreak in Africa is severe and spreading rapidly, with the Africa CDC declaring it a continental public health emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The new Clade I strain (specifically Clade Ib) is more virulent and transmissible than previous strains.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The CDC has already issued health alerts to doctors about the more deadly strain of mpox.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. While the CDC states that the risk of Clade I mpox spreading to the US is \"very low,\" they are actively monitoring the situation and preparing updated health notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. International travel, though limited, still occurs between affected regions and the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors, it's reasonable to expect that a case could be detected in the US within the next week, likely around August 21, 2024. This allows time for potential transmission, incubation, symptom development, and confirmation by the CDC. The CDC's heightened alertness and preparation suggest they are anticipating the possibility of a case and would likely confirm it quickly if detected.\n",
      "27200 15 The CDC has stated that the risk of Clade I mpox spreading to the US is \"very low.\" Despite the rapid spread and severity of the outbreak in Africa, the monitoring and preventive measures in place in the US, combined with limited travel from affected regions, make it less likely for a case to be confirmed within the next nine days. However, the heightened alert and ongoing monitoring do leave some room for the possibility, albeit low.\n",

      "Forecast 70\n",
      "Rationale The increasing number of joint exercises, military tensions, and confrontations in the South China Sea along with heightened activities near Taiwan significantly raise the risk of an armed forces death occurring before the deadline of October 1, 2024. The presence of multiple nations' forces in close proximity, combined with aggressive maneuvers and occasional hostile incidents, heightens the probability of a fatal clash, even if unintended. Thus, evaluating the current dynamics and risk factors, I assess the probability at 70%. \n",

      "27158 Will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?\n",
      "Forecast 15\n",
      "Rationale Given the historical rarity of brokered conventions and the overwhelming endorsement for Kamala Harris by key Democratic figures, it is unlikely that the Democratic Party will need more than one round of voting to nominate their 2024 presidential candidate. Despite pressures and uncertainties surrounding an open convention, the organization and push for unity in the party will likely mitigate the chances of reaching a brokered convention. Therefore, I assess the probability at 15%. \n",

      "Rationale There is no current evidence of human-to-human transmission of H5N1, and experts maintain that the risk is low. Although the situation is closely monitored and could change, the probability of this occurring and being reported before September 30, 2024, remains relatively low given the data and timelines. \n",

      "27160 Will diplomatic expulsions or recalls take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024?\n",
      "Forecast 75\n",
      "Rationale Given the escalating tensions and the pattern of diplomatic protests and confrontations, there is a high likelihood that either the Philippines or China will take the step of expelling or recalling diplomats as a form of escalating the response. The frequent diplomatic protests and aggressive maneuvers indicate a deteriorating situation that could lead to such actions before the given deadline. \n",

      "Rationale Given the sustained and significant advances by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk Oblast, it is highly probable that Ukrainian-held territory at least five miles inside Russia will remain confined to this oblast by October 1, 2024. The ongoing focus on Kursk Oblast and reports of entrenched positions and strategic gains indicate a high likelihood of continued presence solely in this region. \n",

      "Rationale While the current focus of Ukrainian advances is predominantly in Kursk Oblast, the possibility of expanding the offensive into adjacent oblasts remains. The logistical and strategic demands of opening another front may lower the probability, but it cannot be fully ruled out, especially if the Kursk offensive achieves its immediate objectives sooner than expected. \n",
