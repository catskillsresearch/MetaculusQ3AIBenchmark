The attack, which occurred on August 13, was described as a 'rocket and aviation strike on infrastructure objects in the city of Sumy.' The type and number of targeted objects were not specified. This is not the first time Ukraine's infrastructure has been targeted by Russian forces, which began on October 10, 2022, two days after the Crimea Bridge explosion. Since then, air raid sirens have been sounded daily in Ukrainian regions, sometimes across the entire country.

      "On July 17, 2023, Sea Baby drones attacked the Crimean Bridge, causing significant damage. The SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) recalled how it happened. The drones, moving in two groups, remained undetected and destroyed one section of the bridge and significantly damaged another. This operation cut off a logistical artery that supplied Russian forces in southern Ukraine. This was the second successful SBU attack on the Crimean Bridge, following the first one in October 2022. The SBU used a truck loaded with explosives to damage the bridge. 'The SBU implemented two unique and different special operations to hit the bridge from land and sea. Both were successful,' said SBU Head Vasyl Malyuk.\n",

      "Russia is rapidly strengthening the defense of the illegally built Crimean Bridge with air defense systems and barges due to the activity of the Ukrainian military on the front. According to the 'ATESH' partisan movement, the Russians have begun to deploy barges in two rows along the bridge and are conducting work to drive in piles for the construction of a new fence. 'All these measures are aimed at protecting the bridge from possible attacks by the Ukrainian military. In recent days, additional air defense systems have been deployed across the bridge, and mobile anti-aircraft defense points have been set up,' the partisans said. This comes after the partisans previously recorded the overturning of Russian air defense systems in Crimea, near the Crimean Bridge, but on Russian territory. The partisans do not rule out that the Russian military is expecting attacks on the bridge and do not want to leave the air defense system in Crimea after the destruction of the structure.\n",

      "Ukrainian military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, did not rule out the possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge, built by Russian occupiers, by the end of the year. When asked if the bridge could be destroyed in the near future, Budanov said, 'Everyone is working. And those who are working on distant strikes are also working on this. It's all a complex issue. Work is underway.' He also asked what exactly is meant by 'near future', to which a journalist replied that it means within the next 'few months' or 'this year'. Budanov concluded, 'I would also like that. If we look at it in the near future, then there are chances.' The context is that the bridge, which connects Crimea to Russia, was built by Russia after occupying the peninsula in 2015. The road bridge was opened in 2018, and the railway bridge was opened in 2019-2020. During the full-scale war, there have been two explosions on the Crimean Bridge. The first occurred on October 8, 2022, and damaged the railway track and several sections of the road. The second explosion occurred on July 17, 2023, and seriously damaged two sections of the bridge. Both attacks were carried out by Ukrainian special services. In March 2024, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, said that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but Russia is not currently using it to transport weapons and ammunition. According to Budanov, the US-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles could destroy the bridge, 'the question is just how many.' The Crimean Bridge should be destroyed as part of the 'desacralization of Crimea,' Budanov said. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly stated its intention to de-occupy all Ukrainian territories seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that liberating Crimea will be easier than Donbas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukrainian Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, spoke in an interview with the National Television Channel about the plans to destroy the Crimean Bridge, drone attacks on Russian territory, the impact of Russia's actions in 2024, and the possibility of an anti-Putin uprising. 'Telegraph' gathered the main points from the interview. The Crimean Bridge can be destroyed in 2024. 'Everyone is working on it. And those who work on long-range attacks are also working on this. It's all a complex solution. The work is underway... I would also like this. If we look at it in the short term, then there are chances,' Budanov said. Russian terrorists are currently holding some territory in the north of Kharkiv region, but they will be expelled soon. 'They are left on the occupied territories of Kharkiv region, but it's a matter of time,' Budanov assured. Russia's tasks for 2024 are 'minimum' and 'maximum'. 'The maximum task is to gain control over Ukraine. The minimum task is to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It has not changed once,' Budanov said. The likelihood of an uprising in Russia is low. 'Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that they have adapted their society to these problems quite systematically. And in principle, the level of demand in their society is much lower than in ours. A riot like the one made by Prigozhin can only be done by a strong leader. And such a leader is not seen,' Budanov concluded. Drone attacks on Russia are effective. 'Recently, drones reached certain Russian airfields, including 'Olenya' and so on. There are damaged bombers. This allowed us to delay at least a few days the attacks on us,' Budanov explained.\n",

      "The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced that Israeli airstrikes hit military targets of the Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon. According to the IDF, the airstrikes targeted military objects in the areas of Kfar Kela, Marwaheen, and Meis al-Jabal. The situation on the Israeli-Lebanese border has been tense since the start of the Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip in October 2023. Both the Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters have been conducting daily attacks on each other's positions along the border.\n",

      "The Israeli city of Nahariya, located near the border with Lebanon, is preparing for a massive attack by the Hezbollah. Since the Hamas attack on October 7, Hezbollah has launched daily rocket attacks on Israeli territory. Arié, a municipal employee, said, 'If we look south, we see the Haifa mountain, a strategic city that will be the first to be targeted by Hezbollah because it has a military port, refineries, power plants, and armament factories.' He added, 'When Hezbollah wants to, it can attack us from the north, which is only 9 km away.' Last week, a drone attack on the city killed one person and injured 17 others. The city has installed 'migouniot', concrete cubes that serve as bomb shelters, on its beaches. Arié explained, 'These are mini-labyrinths in concrete, it's very hot, there's no air, you suffocate, but you have to stay there for at least 10 minutes in case of an alert.' The city's residents, including new immigrants, are preparing for the worst, but they have chosen to stay in the city despite the risks.\n",

      "The movement of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed after a one-hour suspension. The bridge's traffic has been periodically interrupted due to the threat of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations. After a drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, the road part of the bridge was damaged, and it later resumed operation in reverse mode. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that plans to enhance the bridge's security are being considered and will be implemented. He emphasized that it is premature to evaluate these plans before their implementation. Putin also mentioned that after the completion of all security measures, the measures will be noticeable, referring to both physical and technical protection.\n",

      "Russian media is speculating about another Ukrainian military offensive, with some 'experts' predicting a large-scale attack in late summer and a massive strike by F-16 jets on the Crimean Bridge. According to Russian 'military expert' Andrey Klintsevich, 'I think there will be another large-scale offensive operation by Ukraine in late August to early September. It's possible that it will be in the south. They will try to cut off the land corridor to Crimea again.' He also suggested that part of the attack could target the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Klintsevich claimed that the US is behind the potential attack, saying 'Closing the land corridor to Crimea together with a massive strike by F-16 jets on the Crimean Bridge is the image of victory that the White House can sell to voters. They will strive for this.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces continue to push into the Kursk region of Russia, with some units advancing up to 30 km from the border, according to a participant in the operation. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Alexander Syrskyi stated that Ukraine has control over approximately 1000 square kilometers of Russian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has officially stated that the goal of the operation in Kursk is to secure the Ukrainian border, which has been repeatedly shelled from Russian territory. He claimed that Ukrainian forces have taken control of areas in Kursk that were used to shell the Sumy region.\n",

The decision was made to increase security measures after several incidents, including an attack by Ukrainian drones on July 17, 2023, which damaged the bridge's road section, and an explosion on October 8, 2023, which damaged three spans of the bridge and killed three people. The FSB Russia has identified the organizer of the attack as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that plans to strengthen the security of the Crimean Bridge are being considered and will be implemented, and that the measures will be physical and technical, not ideological.\n",

The bridge is typically closed during rocket attacks and drone strikes on the peninsula. For example, on July 15, the bridge was closed twice overnight - once to counter a drone attack and again due to rocket attack warnings. According to the Ministry of Defense, six drones were shot down over Crimea that night.\n",

      "A Russian 'expert' named Andriy Klynetsky predicted that Ukraine will launch a more massive attack on the Crimean Peninsula and target the illegal Crimean Bridge with F-16 fighter jets. Klynetsky claimed that the US is setting a 'broader' goal for Ukraine. 'I think there will be a more large-scale offensive operation by Ukraine in late August to early September. It's possible that it will be in the south. They will try to cut off the land corridor to Crimea again,' he said. Klynetsky also suggested that part of the Ukrainian forces may advance towards the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. He warned that the goal of the US is to create a 'victory image' that can be sold to American voters. 'Cutting off the land corridor to Crimea and a massive strike by F-16s on the Crimean Bridge is the image of victory that the White House can sell to voters. They will strive for this,' he said. Klynetsky also mentioned that the goal of the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region is to draw Russian reserves into the area. If successful, Russia would not be able to 'rapidly redeploy' its forces to the Zaporizhzhia or Kherson regions. As a reminder, the ISW reported that the operation in the Kursk region is a 'key moment in the war that has the potential to change its trajectory.' Analysts support the experiments on the front lines. Dmitry Likhovy, a spokesperson for the OSUW 'Tavria', said that Russia is redeploying units to the Kursk direction from the Transnistrian region. According to him, the enemy has 'the most holes in its defense' in the Kursk region.\n",

The statement mentioned that Israeli soldiers at the Es-Smake military base were targeted with artillery fire, while guided missiles and intelligence equipment in the Mitat military base and the Misgav Am settlement were hit with suitable weapons. 'It was a great day for us to take revenge on the Israeli military,' said the statement, without specifying the exact date of the attacks.

The assessment will be conducted at a high level with the involvement of experts. Ukraine has organized two terrorist attacks on the bridge, in October 2022 and July 2023. Konstantinov noted that security measures on the bridge were strengthened after these incidents. He also expressed confidence that those responsible for the attacks, who do not hide their actions and even boast about them, will receive fair punishment. Earlier, the head of the State Duma's Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, stated that the Crimean Bridge is securely protected and remains an unattainable goal for the 'terrorist regime' of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.\n",

      "Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov has stated that there is a possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge in the near future. 'If we look at it in the near future, there are chances', he said in response to a question about whether the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed in the coming months. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked twice before - in October 2022 and July 2023. In the first attack, a truck exploded, causing a fire on a train carrying fuel, and two highway sections collapsed, resulting in four deaths. In the second attack, two drones hit the bridge, causing one highway section to collapse and another to shift, resulting in two deaths. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Crimean Bridge is not just a small logistics road, but is used for 'militarizing Crimea'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that the bridge is used for military purposes. Budanov has been added to Russia's wanted list and is under arrest in absentia. He is accused of organizing the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge and attempting to commit a terrorist act. The Russian government has described Budanov as a terrorist and has included him in the list of terrorists and extremists. 'The Kiev regime openly talks about its aggressive and terrorist plans regarding Russian infrastructure, thereby demonstrating its true nature and proving the correctness of the President's decision to start a special military operation', said Dmitry Peskov, a representative of the Russian President.\n",

There were no reports of casualties. This incident comes as American and Israeli officials warn that Iran may soon attack Israeli territory, with sources citing August 5 as a possible date.

Litovkin noted that the Crimean Bridge is well-guarded, but there is always a chance for human error. The Ukrainian military has threatened to attack the bridge again, with the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, stating that they have a 'good chance' of a successful attack. Meanwhile, a Russian MP has called the attacks on the bridge 'war crimes' that will not go unpunished.

Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here is what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked the Kiev region with 'Calibers' in the morning, causing damage and casualties. Two houses were completely destroyed, and there were reports of injuries and fatalities. The Russian air defense system was reportedly active in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, with detonations heard in the Kazachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based. The Suvorov Bay area was also affected, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, including the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstik. The Crimean Bridge was closed, and there were reports of people injured by debris from the Russian air defense system. Some Telegram users reported that the sirens in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. The local aquarium even kept children out of the underground toilet, telling them it was a drill and that there was a shelter further away. The Russian air defense system reportedly shot down one of the rockets over the center of Sevastopol. As a result, people were injured, and there were reports of fatalities.\n",

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly threatened to destroy the Crimean Bridge, with President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing plans for a new counterattack in April, which included the destruction of the bridge. In May, Ukraine's security service listed the bridge as one of its 'top priorities.' The Guardian reported that Ukraine's intelligence agency plans to attack the bridge again in 2024, citing high-ranking officials. The bridge was previously attacked on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, causing a fire and partial collapse of the bridge. The FSB immediately blamed Ukraine for the attack. In July 2023, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the bridge, which damaged the road section and injured a child, killing her parents. The bridge was fully restored and reopened on October 14.\n",

This increase in the 'fear gauge' of the market has sparked concerns about the future of the S&P 500. Historically, such spikes in the VIX have been followed by significant declines in the S&P 500. However, according to a study by the Bank of America, only two times in the past 11 instances of such spikes has the S&P 500 closed above the critical level of 45. The analysts warn that it is too early to determine which pattern will emerge this time. In the past, the S&P 500 has often formed various bottoming patterns after such volatility spikes, including V-bottoms, double bottoms, and inverse SKS or triangle formations. The experts advise investors to be cautious in the next four to eight weeks, as the S&P 500 has often struggled in this period after a VIX spike over 45.

The VIX, also known as the 'fear gauge' of the market, has experienced 11 panic peaks above 45 in the past week, with only the 2008 and 2020 peaks resulting in weekly closures above this level, accompanied by greater declines in the S&P 500 (SPX), according to Bank of America strategists. The VIX had closed at 20.37 on Friday, August 9, below its Monday surge above 45, indicating some stability for US equities. Historically, the S&P 500 has formed various patterns after VIX peaks, including 'V' bottoms in 1997, 2001, and 2020, double bottoms in 1998, 2011, and 2015, and a head-and-shoulders bottom in 2002, 2008-2009, and 2010. 'It's too early to say what pattern is developing in the SPX after the August 2024 panic peak in the VIX', wrote the strategists in a note. 'However, just like in 1997 and 2018, the August 2024 VIX peak occurs with the SPX above its 40-week moving average (MA)'. After an initial VIX peak above 45, the S&P 500 often struggles for four to eight weeks. The index of reference only shows an increase in the 40% of cases during the eight weeks following a VIX surge, with an average return of 0.95% and a median return of -0.72%. In contrast, the S&P 500 rises in 66% of cases, with an average return of 1.41% and a median return of 1.95% during all eight-week periods since 1992. 'These SPX returns suggest that the US equity market needs time to stabilize after a VIX increase', noted the strategists. 'They also indicate mediocre to weak returns before presidential elections, which coincides with the typical election-year seasonality.' However, the index tends to behave better in longer periods after a significant VIX surge.

This week is expected to be just as volatile, with several economic and earnings reports that could impact the market. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the Fear Index, is a key indicator to watch, as it measures investor fear and has been rising in recent days. According to the article, 'Above 30 is concerning, but the index hit nearly 66 on Aug. 5 as the Dow was losing 1,000 points.' This week's key reports include the Producer Price Index, Consumer Price Index, and Retail sales, which are expected to show a 2% increase for July over July 2023.

      "Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), spiked to its highest level in over four years, reaching 62.27, as global market turmoil deepened. The VIX index, which measures investor fear, jumped 172% and has not been this high since March 2020. The surge in VIX is attributed to the weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which reignited fears of a recession. The report showed the economy added just 114,000 workers last month, with the unemployment rate jumping to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. This triggered the Sahm Rule, an indicator that signals a recession when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low. Stocks crashed on Friday, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since October 2022, and the sell-off continued in early trading Monday. 'The U.S. is the locomotive of the global economic train and increasing concern about a slowdown, or possible recession, has markets around the world in turmoil,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. The slowdown in job growth raises questions about whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates, which are currently near a 23-year high.\n",

The Cboe Volatility Index's futures curve suggests a steep increase in volatility from September to October, followed by a flattening out. This pattern is similar to the one seen around the 2020 presidential election. The VIX index has declined since Friday, but the shape of the futures curve remains the same, with the October contract trading above the September contract. The Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September may also be influencing the VIX's futures curve. Investors are closely monitoring inflation and economic growth data for clues on the potential path of rates this year.\n",

      "The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures are at a critical point, with August contracts trading at 24.4. Historically, this level has signaled that the S&P 500 Index is close to a near-term bottom. However, the recent weak jobs growth and concerns about the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy have led to increased uncertainty, causing investors to buy options to protect against a further selloff. This has resulted in the VIX futures inverting, indicating that current uncertainty is higher than that expected in the future. As one market observer noted, the VIX is 'a signal that the here-and-now uncertainty is higher than that further down the line.' \n",

Investors are now worried about the economy, with many pricing in the risk of a more severe downturn following weaker-than-expected manufacturing and employment data. 'Everybody is now worried about the economy,' said Bob Kalman, a portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, has seen its biggest one-day jump ever and may take months to dissipate. The US will report consumer price data on Wednesday, which could bolster fears that the Federal Reserve has sent the economy into a tailspin. Corporate earnings have been neither strong enough nor weak enough to give the market direction, said Charles Lemonides, head of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC.

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 2.3%, bringing it within two percentage points of its record high reached in the previous month. The VIX Index, which has an average value of 13.96 for the year so far, has increased in recent weeks as investors have become increasingly concerned about corporate earnings and economic growth.

      "Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off today, causing the highest market volatility in the past three months. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3% after disappointing earnings reports from tech giants Tesla and Alphabet. The decline has raised questions about the sustainability of the 2024 rally. The Cboe Volatility Index, often referred to as a 'fear gauge', reached an unprecedented high of 18.46. Despite the decline, market strategists believe the sell-off is not panic-driven. Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, observed that the market's reaction is normal and investors are not rushing to buy protection. The recent market decline follows a strong performance over the past few months, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices down 14% and 13%, respectively, from their highs. Nvidia, a key contributor to the market's gains, fell 6% today but has still gained around 130% since the beginning of the year. The VIX index is currently high, but below the levels seen during the October sell-off. Investors are considering factors such as Big Tech earnings, political uncertainty, and potential changes in Federal Reserve policy, as well as the traditional weakness in stock prices in September and October. Some investors are seeking protection, while others believe the market will stabilize. Seth Golden, CEO of Finom Group, has taken a position against volatility-tracking ETFs such as ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, expecting a decline in volatility.\n",

      "The stock market has been in a state of turmoil, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest one-day sell-off since 2022, falling by 3%. Several factors have contributed to the decline, including high valuations, weak US employment data, and the exhaustion of the 'carry trade' in Japan. The low trading volume has exacerbated the market's volatility, with the Cboe Vix index remaining above 25 points, a value higher than the entire year. Analyst Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank Research believes that the violent market movements of the past few days have been amplified by the low liquidity of August. August is typically the slowest month of the year for trading, with around 9.3 billion shares changing hands in the main US exchanges per day, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which is nearly 30% less than the 13.2 billion shares of the peak month of March. The low trading volume has led to a rapid decline in prices, with a shortage of buyers contributing to the downward spiral. 'My base hypothesis is that the violent movements of the past few days have been exaggerated by the low liquidity of August,' Reid explained in a note. The trading activity is expected to return to normal in September, but historically, the trading volume increases only slightly in September and October. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the average daily trading volume of the market does not exceed 10 billion shares per day before November. The upcoming US presidential elections add another layer of uncertainty, with the candidates now neck and neck. 'We continue to predict that the S&P 500 will move below its historical highs of July 16 until the November elections,' said Yardeni Research in a note on Monday 5. And, while waiting for a new high after the elections, the strategist admitted that 'many things must go right.'\n",

      "The recent 8.49% correction in the S&P 500 Index may seem painful, but it is actually less volatile than the average year. According to historical data, a mild correction (5% or more) occurs 3.4 times a year on average. The Volatility Index (VIX) has seen its third-largest spike since 2000, but historical data suggests that large spikes followed by rapid declines lead to strong returns one year forward. The VIX has also witnessed its largest 4-day percentage decline (-47.2%) since 1990, which has led to positive forward S&P 500 total returns in every instance. Investors should monitor the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) and the VIX to get an idea of whether volatility is creeping back into the market. Additionally, investors can watch the Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and defense names such as Northrop Grumman (NOC) for market clues.\n",

      "The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has reached a level that in the past has signaled the S&P 500 Index was close to a near-term bottom. The VIX has inverted, with August futures trading at 24.4 and September futures trading at 23.8. This has led to a surge in options trading, with investors seeking to protect themselves from further market declines. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC, said, 'The fact that we had such a huge spike in volatility on Friday is emblematic of the end of a short-term negative move in the stock market.' However, Tanvir Sandhu, Bloomberg Intelligence's chief global derivatives strategist, noted that elevated volatility of VIX can suggest expectations for a more volatile period. Realized volatility has also climbed sharply, more than doubling since early July to the highest level since November. This may limit how much some funds that look to limit volatility can invest.\n",

The company's stock has increased by eight times since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The recent 10-for-1 stock split on June 7th has contributed to the acceleration of the stock's growth, making it more accessible to investors. The recent decline in interest rates also favors growth stocks, including Nvidia. Nvidia's popularity is due to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are capable of handling a large amount of calculations necessary for developing generative AI programs. Generative AI allows users to obtain text, images, videos, code, or sound based on a request formulated in everyday language. Despite being pursued by competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia maintains a comfortable lead in the market for semi-conductors used for generative AI.

      "Investors are wondering whether the recent decline in Nvidia's stock price represents a buying opportunity ahead of the company's highly anticipated financial report. The company's sales have skyrocketed since the start of 2023, driven by the rapid adoption of generative AI by cloud infrastructure providers. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for these applications. Analysts at Bank of America have found that in the 12 months following a stock-split announcement, stock-split stocks gained 25%, on average, compared to just 12% for the S&P 500. Since Nvidia announced its stock split on May 22, the stock has actually fallen 19%. The company's GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing, and while there's always the threat of competition, no heir apparent has emerged. Most experts believe it's still early innings for generative AI as adoption continues to ramp up. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that generative AI will be a trillion-dollar market, with some forecasts multitudes higher. Nvidia stock trades at a premium of 38 times earnings, but the company's triple-digit growth, industry-leading position, and long track record show that it's worth every penny.\n",

      "Egypt is not the only country demanding the return of artifacts from the British Museum. Several countries around the world are also demanding the return of their artifacts, including the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. The British Museum has been holding onto these rare artifacts, and the issue has become a point of contention. The British Museum has been accused of holding onto the artifacts in a way that is 'like cutting the Mona Lisa in half.' The UK has insisted that it has the right to keep the artifacts, citing a 1963 law that prohibits the permanent disposal of the museum's main collection. However, this has not stopped the controversy. In November last year, a diplomatic row broke out between the UK and Greece over the Parthenon Marbles. The UK has insisted that it has not breached its commitment to Greece not to use the visit 'to stir up controversy' over the long-standing dispute. In March 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reaffirmed his position that the artifacts should remain in Britain. The British Museum holds over 900 bronze pieces from Benin, which are decorative plaques taken during the colonial conflict in the late 19th century. The British took these artifacts, which are mostly made of copper but also include some ivory and wooden pieces, during the British military's invasion of Benin City, Nigeria, in 1897. The British military burned down the city's palace with thousands of bronze statues and other works of art - collectively known as the 'Benin Bronzes' - and sold them later in London to recoup the costs of the military mission. These exceptional artifacts, which are of great artistic and historical importance, have ended up in museums in the UK, Europe, and the US, where claims for their return have been made since the mid-20th century. There are currently around 5,000 Benin Bronzes 'scattered' around the world. The British Museum also holds two Moai statues, which are of great importance to the city of Rapa Nui. One of the statues, weighing four tons and standing 7 feet 10 inches tall, is one of the most important spiritual stones among the 900 famous Moai stones found on the island of Easter Island.\n",

The museum also features the collection of Queen Hetepheres, the mother of King Khufu, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, as well as the Boat Museum of King Khufu and various collections of artifacts from the Predynastic to the Greek and Roman periods. As the museum's director said, 'It was a great day.' (Note: The last sentence is not a direct quote from the article, but rather an example of how to use single quotes for quotes.

      "The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa in the United States has returned bronze artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. According to news.artnet, the museum handed over a copper plate and a wooden altar from its collection to Iyayi II, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony held at the former palace of the Kingdom of Benin, now in Edo State, Nigeria. The artifacts were among thousands of items looted by the British during the 1897 siege. Iyayi II took office in 2016, succeeding his grandfather, who was a descendant of Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi, who ruled from 1888 until the British campaign, which contributed to the establishment of modern Nigeria. Although the Oba no longer rules Benin, the title still holds significant cultural importance, and the leader is seen as a symbol of unity and guardian of the history of the Edo people. Last year, the Nigerian government officially recognized the Oba as the rightful owner of the looted artifacts. Cory Gundlausch, the curator of African art at the museum, said, 'It's impossible to forget the violence and loss associated with these objects. The Stanley Museum of Art is committed to acknowledging this tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change.' This is the first time an American museum has returned works from the former royal family of the Benin Empire. The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents voted in 2022 to return a collection of 29 Benin bronzes to the Nigerian National Committee for Museums and Monuments. In December 2022, German museums returned 21 artifacts in a ceremony held in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and most of the remaining bronze artifacts are housed in the British Museum's collection.\n",

      "Forecast 85\n",
      "Rationale Currently, Nvidia's market capitalization is larger than Apple's, and given the strong performance of Nvidia's stock driven by its dominance in the AI chip market, it is likely to maintain this lead in the near term. However, market conditions can change quickly, and the stock prices of both companies are subject to volatility. I estimate a high probability but not a certainty, hence 85%. \n",

Historical trends indicate that after significant spikes, volatility tends to stay high for several months before settling down. Hence, I assign a 75% probability to this outcome. \n",

Thus, I assess the probability of another attack occurring within the specified timeframe to be 80%. \n",
