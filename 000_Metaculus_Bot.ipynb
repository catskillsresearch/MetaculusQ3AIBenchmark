      "When WM Motor, a Chinese electric vehicle startup, filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, its owners encountered issues with their vehicles going 'offline.' Richard Qian, a WM Motor owner, discovered that he could no longer log into the company's smartphone app, which remotely controlled the car lock and air conditioner, and couldn't see his car's mileage and charging status on the dashboard. This is a concern for many Chinese EV owners, as their cars rely heavily on cloud services, including smartphone controls and software updates. With over 100 Chinese EV manufacturers struggling for survival, an estimated 160,000 car owners are left in the lurch, worried about their access to factory parts in future repairs. Lei Xing, an EV analyst, said, 'The biggest concern [for EV owners] is battery degradation, and secondly the operability and stability of the software.' The Chinese government is trying to boost the EV sector with new consumer incentives, but investors are warning that many EV startups will struggle to stay afloat. 'Many will be under pressure for sure, but we're unlikely to see announcements of 'We're done,' said Xing. 'It's a slow-death process.'\n",

      "Japan has condemned China's incursion into its airspace as a 'grave violation of sovereignty'. According to a Japanese government spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, 'The violation of our airspace by a Chinese military plane is not only a grave violation of our sovereignty, but also a threat to our security and is totally unacceptable.' Japan has deployed fighter jets after a Chinese surveillance plane, a Y-9, entered Japanese airspace near the Danjo islands in Nagasaki prefecture for two minutes on Monday. Hayashi stated that 'We understand that this is the first confirmed and announced incursion of a Chinese military plane since we began taking measures against airspace incursions.' China has responded by saying it is 'verifying' whether one of its military planes violated Japanese airspace. 'The relevant Chinese authorities are investigating and verifying,' said Lin Jian, a Chinese diplomatic spokesperson. 'Both sides maintain communication through existing working channels. I would also like to emphasize that China has no intention of invading the airspace of any country,' he added.\n",

      "Equity investors are cautious ahead of key US data and Nvidia's earnings release, which could impact demand for artificial intelligence. Despite a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut, traders are awaiting next week's non-farm payrolls figures. Traders remain upbeat, but attention turns to US indicators, including GDP growth, inflation, and jobless claims. Nvidia's earnings report is the headliner, with analysts warning that a disappointing result could spark a sell-off in the sector. As Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank said, 'The rebound in stock markets after the July crunch, lower gasoline prices and the heightened prospect of near-term interest rate cuts look to have overwhelmed the impact on confidence of softening labour market indicators.' Analyst Stephen Innes noted, 'This is the one that could either lift all boats or sink the entire fleet.' Asian markets were mixed, with Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore dropping, while Tokyo, Wellington, and Taipei gained. Oil prices edged higher after big swings due to the Middle East crisis and Libya's decision to close fields and suspend production and exports. 'Nvidia's influence is undeniable, making it nearly impossible to take your eyes off it,' Innes added.\n",

However, a person briefed on the Harris campaign's thinking said the issue of whether microphones will be muted when a candidate isn't speaking remains an open discussion. Trump's team favors muted microphones, while the Harris team does not. Trump wrote that the debate rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which was 'calamitous' for President Joe Biden. Harris spokesperson Ammar Moussa said, 'Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate, but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him.' Trump said, 'Doesn't matter to me, I'd rather have it probably on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.'\n",

However, historical precedents of uncertainty and last-minute cancellations involving Trump, combined with ongoing disputes over debate rules, introduce a degree of unpredictability. Taking all this into account, I assign a 75% probability that the debate will proceed as scheduled on September 10, 2024.\n",
