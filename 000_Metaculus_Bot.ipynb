      "The US stock market experienced significant fluctuations as investors digested the latest inflation reports, which showed a 2.5% increase in August. The NASDAQ attempted to stabilize as traders took advantage of opportunities in technology stocks. The main Wall Street indices declined as uncertainty grew about the Federal Reserve's (US central bank) interest rate path following the latest inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 650 points, the S&P 500 index dropped 1.5%, and the NASDAQ composite index declined 0.70%. Meanwhile, shares of Intel and Apple rose by over 2% and 1% respectively, while shares of UnitedHealth Group, Goldman Sachs, and Amgen contributed to the decline in the Dow Jones.\n",

      "Apple's new campus building, Apple Park Observatory, resembles a futuristic Hobbit hole from J.R.R. Tolkien's books. The subterranean venue is built into the hillside of Apple Park, the company's $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, California. According to Dezeen, the event space is designed to host Apple employees, tech journalists, and YouTubers to showcase the company's latest gadgets. As Dezeen describes it, 'it was a great day' to unveil the new venue, but it's unclear who said this. The Apple Park Observatory is a unique addition to the company's campus, blending seamlessly into the surrounding landscape.\n",

      "The Cleveland Guardians are at risk of facing the New York Yankees in a Wild Card game if they lose their lead in the AL Central. The Guardians have a 3.5 game lead over the Kansas City Royals, but with 17 games remaining, the Royals could take the lead and demote the Guardians to a Wild Card spot. The Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are separated by just a half-game in the AL East, and if both teams win their divisions, the likely matchup in a Wild Card game would be the Guardians and Yankees. The Guardians have a poor record against the Yankees, with a 2-4 record and being outscored 36-22. Star player Aaron Judge has been particularly dominant against the Guardians, hitting five home runs in 24 at-bats. The Guardians would likely finish below the Yankees in the standings if they lose their lead, and would then have to play in New York for the three-game series, where they have a record of 40-37. 'The end of the season is important for the Guardians,' said the article, 'to keep the Yankees as far away as possible, the team should look to clinch the AL Central.'\n",

      "FORECASTING Intel dropped from Dow\n",
      "28024 10 Given that the consensus amongst analysts is that Intel's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average is likely to occur sometime in 2025, it seems improbable that such an announcement would be made before October 1, 2024. There is no indication of immediate plans for removal in the short timeframe left until the question's end date. Therefore, the probability of Intel being dropped from the DJIA before the specified date is low.\n",

The Yankees have been performing well recently, while the Guardians' schedule difficulty could hinder their chances to catch up. The probability reflects the current competitive scenario and recent performance trends.\n"
