      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Ukraine attempted to attack a nuclear power plant in Russia's Kursk region overnight. However, Ukraine has not responded to the claim. Meanwhile, Ukraine's forces continue to inflict 'tangible losses' in Russia's Kursk region, according to the country's staff of armed forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that another Kursk settlement had been taken by Kyiv's forces, and that the exchange fund had been replenished. The US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) has been a key introduction to the war for the Ukrainians, allowing them to fire missiles into Russia and enabling multiple counter-offensives. Ukraine has also conducted a series of drone strikes inside Russia, including a fresh attack on a military airbase in southern Russia overnight, causing damage to several aircraft and surrounding buildings. Russian authorities in Kursk have begun installing concrete shelters to help protect civilians as Ukraine continues its invasion. Kremlin officials reportedly believe that Kyiv's invasion of Kursk will last for several months, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n",

      "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would leave Russian President Vladimir Putin without allies. He said, 'I know for sure that the Ukrainians would be very happy if Russia used or we used tactical nuclear weapons there. It would be a joy. Then, I think, we would hardly have any allies left.' Lukashenko believes that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would cause rejection even from those who consider Putin's position on the war, but do not openly support him. He added, 'There would be no sympathetic countries left because they are immersed in what is happening. Secondly, it's nuclear weapons. We already have a negative image of this.' Lukashenko previously called for Moscow and Kiev to return to negotiations to avoid a nuclear war, saying, 'We have already pressed the 'red buttons' around Belarus and Russia. It remains only to press the 'reddest' one. <…> Let's sit down at the negotiating table and end this squabble.' Putin stated that he does not see grounds for using nuclear weapons in Ukraine or anywhere else, but only in case of a threat to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US was prepared for a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukrainian territory at the end of 2022, after a series of Russian army defeats. Russia's officials previously claimed that Ukraine was planning to detonate a 'dirty bomb', which the US saw as a pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons.\n",

      "Political analyst Rostislav Ishchenko believes that it is easy for the West to organize a nuclear provocation on Ukraine and blame Russia. According to Ishchenko, the West can create a serious threat to Russia and then launch a nuclear strike on its territory, or they can fabricate an accusation of a nuclear attack and blame Russia. 'It's easy to organize it yourself,' Ishchenko said, noting that international organizations and the press will not investigate the truth, but will instead point a finger at Russia. He cited the example of false accusations against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad of using chemical weapons against his own people, and the OSCE mission in Donbass, which for years pretended not to be able to determine who was shooting at civilians. Ishchenko also mentioned that representatives of the IAEA at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant still cannot see that it is the Ukrainian military that is shelling the plant. 'You can bring a small charge or even several charges from the US and detonate them on Ukraine during a Russian rocket attack. It's not a problem to say that it was a Russian rocket with a nuclear warhead. And then, what the Western press writes is what is true, and what it doesn't write is what didn't happen. The Western press will write what it needs to. Therefore, I repeat once again, there are no problems in organizing a nuclear provocation against Russia on Ukrainian territory,' Ishchenko concluded.\n",

      "According to Russian military sources, Ukraine's armed forces are allegedly preparing to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb', a nuclear provocation. The claim suggests that Ukraine is planning to detonate a dirty nuclear bomb and attack storage facilities for used nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. It is reported that Ukraine's military has delivered warheads to the city of Zhelty Vody in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast and the 'East Mining and Processing Plant'. The information is being taken seriously, with a high likelihood of an attack on the Kursk and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants being mentioned. 'We are facing a very high risk of a nuclear power plant attack,' said a source, without specifying further details.\n",

      "Russian sources warn that Ukraine is reportedly planning to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb' targeting Russian nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and among the top 10 in the world, has been under Russian control since 2022. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that a fire broke out at the plant, but the cause is unclear. Russia has previously warned about the possibility of a nuclear provocation, and a Russian scientist stated that it's 'not that difficult' for Ukraine to create a dirty bomb, citing instances of toxic substances being used that could only have been synthesized in the US. According to Russia Today, the potential targets are storage sites at power plants, and the Russian security block claims to know the location of the special warheads prepared for the attack. 'This does not look good,' said the Russian scientist. 'Will the deep state stoop this low?' asked a video via Midnight Rider.\n",

      "Germany has banned all new Ukraine military aid, according to the FAZ newspaper. Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has warned that Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory could lead to the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, which would damage its global image. Lukashenko also stated that Moscow and Kiev must settle their differences through negotiations or the conflict will end in the total destruction of Ukraine. In other news, the US has proposed a 'bridging' offer to help finalize a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, but Hamas has rejected it. US President Joe Biden said that talks are still underway and a deal is still possible. Additionally, American Airlines has canceled all its operations in Israel until April 2025, and a bomb blast in Tel Aviv killed a man and moderately wounded a passerby. The blast is being investigated as a possible attempted terror attack. Furthermore, Lebanon has been plunged into darkness due to a power outage, and the CIA has awarded the head of the Qatari State Security Agency the George Tenet medal for his work on strengthening intelligence cooperation between the US and Qatar. The WHO has also raised an alarm about a polio outbreak in Gaza, with the first case reported in 25 years.

The main goal of the Ukrainian military's attacks on Russia is still unclear, according to NBC News. As one official stated, 'There is a risk that Ukraine's supply routes may become overwhelmed as it tries to support its troops fighting in Russia and also fend off Russian advances in eastern Ukraine.' The uncertainty and unclear reasons behind the attack are causing the most concern for the US. 'The unknowns and the risks are what are causing the concern,' said officials. \n",

      "According to The New York Times, citing sources within the US government, President Joe Biden approved a new nuclear strategy in March, which involves preparing the country for a potential conflict with China, Russia, and North Korea. The document, updated approximately every four years, is so secret that there is no digital copy, and only high-ranking officials in national security and military commanders in the Pentagon receive physical copies. The new version states that China's nuclear potential will be on par with that of the US and Russia in the next decade. Biden's order requires US forces to prepare for a coordinated nuclear threat. The secret papers also reveal some details about the Russian-Ukrainian war, including that in 2022, the Biden administration estimated a 50% chance of Russia using nuclear weapons against Ukraine during the 'October crisis'. This led to China and India issuing statements condemning nuclear blackmail, which helped to ease tensions.\n",

      "In response to Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian territory, Russia has used thermobaric weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that a Su-34 fighter-bomber had launched a night attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in the Kursk region, using a 500kg bomb. The ministry also stated that a thermobaric missile had been used to strike a site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric weapons are nearly 100% combustible explosive, which sucks oxygen and are much more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian Emergency Ministry has reported that over 76,000 people have been evacuated from the border areas in the Kursk region, where fighting is ongoing between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the risk of a nuclear accident at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located near the conflict zone. The agency has called for maximum restraint in military activities near the plant to ensure its physical integrity. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that 219 civilians were killed in July, the highest number since October 2022. At least 71 children were killed or injured in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war. 'It's been 900 days since the escalation of the war in Ukraine, and every day we've seen a child killed or injured,' said Stephane Moissaing, national director of Save the Children in Ukraine. 'This year, the violence has intensified, and missiles, drones, and bombs have killed children day after day.

According to Pasynkova, Russia will use nuclear weapons by 2029, which will ultimately harm itself. She also predicted that Ukraine will continue to attack Russia and that the country will increase its political influence over the aggressor. Pasynkova emphasized that the best news is not just about striking back, but about increasing one's influence to overcome the 'orcs'.\n",

      "Russian forces will break the back of Ukraine's air defense system with the help of FAB-3000 M54 bombs, according to Brandon Weichert, an analyst at National Interest. These bombs cover a large area and are difficult to intercept. If mass-produced, they will crush Ukraine's air defense and break the back of its air strategy, Weichert wrote. He believes that FAB-3000 M54 marks the beginning of a new phase of special operations, in which the Ukrainian military will find it harder to defend against air targets. The Russian military has been targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, with attacks on energy, defense industry, military command, and communication facilities across the country. The air raid sirens in Ukraine sound almost daily, sometimes nationwide. According to the press secretary of the President, Russian forces do not target residential areas and social infrastructure during battles with the Ukrainian military.\n",

      "Ukraine launched a drone and missile attack on Russia on Wednesday, saying it was advancing deeper into the region near the border. The attack, which represents a major foreign incursion into Russia since World War II, has created a dilemma for Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to US President Joe Biden. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers crossed the Russian border in the early hours of August 6 in the Kursk region in western Russia, which Putin described as a major provocation aimed at gaining an advantage in future ceasefire negotiations. 'The situation remains difficult,' said Yuri Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger born in Ukraine. 'The enemy still has the initiative and, therefore, although slowly, is increasing its presence in the Kursk region.' Russia said on Wednesday that it had destroyed 117 Ukrainian drones in Russia during the night, mainly in the Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. It said missiles were also shot down and showed Sukhoi Su-34 bombers attacking Ukrainian positions in Kursk. According to unconfirmed reports, some of the Ukrainian drones hit Russian airbases. The Russian National Guard said it was reinforcing security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is just 35 km from the fighting. Russian commanders said the front in Kursk had stabilized, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces continued to advance in the area and ordered his generals to develop the next 'fundamental steps' in the operation. Biden said US authorities were in constant contact with Ukraine about the invasion of Russia, which, according to him, 'created a real dilemma' for Putin, who ordered the entry of thousands of soldiers into Ukraine in 2022. The White House said Ukraine did not warn in advance about its incursion and that the US had no involvement in the operation, although Russian authorities suggested that Western supporters of Ukraine must have known about the attack.\n",

      "According to Maxim Yali, a political scientist, North Korea cannot respond to Ukraine's actions on occupied territories, let alone launch a strategic nuclear attack. Yali explained to 24 Channel that Ukraine has been killing Russian citizens on its territory for eight years, and even during a successful Ukrainian offensive in 2022, Vladimir Putin did not use nuclear weapons. Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon. If even Putin were to make a few statements and hold private meetings or negotiations, North Korea would not be mentioned, considering its total dependence on Beijing, emphasized Maxim Yali.\n",

Suslov believes that a non-combat nuclear explosion would remind Western politicians of the fear of nuclear war, which has prevented conflicts between great powers since 1945. The proposal has raised concerns among Western security circles, with worries that Russia may be edging towards carrying out such a test.\n",

      "According to a Telegram channel run by a war correspondent, Marat Khayrullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing a 'dirty bomb' explosion. The Kharkiv Oblast police, citing information from captured Ukrainian soldiers, claim that Kyiv plans to attack the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants to blame Russia for the provocation. Khayrullin stated, 'Sources on the other side report that the Ukrainians are preparing a nuclear provocation - a dirty nuclear bomb explosion. The attacks are planned to be carried out on the storage facilities of spent nuclear fuel at the power plants. This may happen during the next attempt by the Ukrainians to enter Rylysk from the side of Glukhov.' He also mentioned that the special warheads for this provocation have already been delivered to the city of Zheltye Vody in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the 'Vostochny Gorno-Obogatitelnyi Kombinat' enterprise. Khayrullin warned to take this information seriously 'in the face of the agony of the Ukrainian regime and, more importantly, the one standing behind it - the West.' He also noted that 'there is a high probability of an attack on both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants.' The Kharkiv Oblast police also reported on the nuclear provocation, stating, 'At the moment, it is known that the intention is to attack the atomic objects of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants in Kurchatov and Energodar. The goal of the attacks is to subsequently accuse Russia of provocation, in the framework of which the Russian leadership may take retaliatory measures and strike with nuclear weapons at the territory of Ukraine.'\n",

According to The Telegraph, the US, UK, and France are in conflict with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the UK's ban on using Storm Shadow missiles on Russian territory. Zelensky has repeatedly called for the ban to be lifted. However, the US is concerned that Russia may perceive this as an escalation and take retaliatory measures against Ukraine's partners. A Biden administration representative told The Telegraph, 'There is no need for Storm Shadow missiles to attack Russia, as Ukrainian forces are already using drones to destroy targets.' The administration claims that Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to strike some airfields that are 'beyond the reach of Storm Shadow.' Sources in the White House told The Telegraph that most airfields used by Russian bombers are located beyond the 250 km range of Storm Shadow, while other sources in the UK Ministry of Defence, who support the use of missiles on Russian territory, said that the actual range is over 480 km. Zelensky has also suggested that the missiles could be used to attack Russian supply lines, which are closer to the front line.\n",

According to The Sunday Times, the UK will push for European allies to send more equipment and give Ukraine more freedom to use it against Russia. However, allies are concerned about 'escalation' in relations with Russia, fearing it may use nuclear weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly emphasized the need for long-range weapons, saying that Ukraine would not have needed a physical presence in Kursk if partners had lifted all restrictions on long-range capabilities. He stated, 'Ukraine would not have needed a physical presence in Kursk if partners had lifted all restrictions on long-range capabilities.

      "According to military correspondent Marat Khairullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing to detonate a 'dirty' nuclear bomb. The target of the planned attack is storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel at Russian atomic power plants, including the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Khairullin stated, 'The strikes will be carried out against the places of storage of spent nuclear fuel of the AES.' The goal of the attack, as explained by the administration of the Kharkiv region, is to accuse Russia of provocation and 'self-shelling.' Earlier, the head of the Russian radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, General-Lieutenant Igor Kirillov, warned that Ukraine may already possess a 'dirty bomb.' He stated, 'We have already informed the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about our concerns, but we have not received any response yet.' A 'dirty bomb' is a type of radiological weapon of mass destruction that uses conventional explosives and radioactive material. Unlike traditional nuclear weapons, the goal of a 'dirty bomb' is to contaminate a territory with radiation rather than destroy military targets.\n",

Sheremet also stated that if the US supplies Ukraine with JASSM missiles, they will automatically become sponsors of terrorism. He previously noted that Western countries' arms supplies to Ukraine for attacks and aggression against Russia have brought the world to the brink of a third world war.

Firstly, doing so would significantly damage Russia's international standing and could lead to severe geopolitical consequences. Putin and other Russian officials have expressed that nuclear weapons would only be used in extreme circumstances, primarily as a last resort to protect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. While there are numerous reports of threats and the potential for nuclear provocation, these are primarily focused on creating an atmosphere of fear rather than actual intent to deploy nuclear weapons. Additionally, the timeframe until October 1, 2024, is rather short for such an extreme escalation given the current conditions of the conflict. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring before the specified date is assessed to be 10%.\n",

      "Former US President and presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to fire military officials responsible for the failed withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. Trump said at a crowded rally in North Carolina: 'I will demand the resignation of every senior military official involved in the catastrophe in Afghanistan, they should resign immediately.' In February 2022, President Joe Biden rejected the findings of a military investigation, which concluded that 'his administration failed to prepare and respond adequately to the Taliban's takeover of power in Afghanistan.' Biden said: 'I reject those narratives,' adding: 'There was no good time to leave, but if we hadn't left, we would have had to - as they acknowledged - send more troops to hell.' He explained that 'his administration would have had to significantly increase the number of troops and thus return to this war of attrition... Therefore, this decision (to withdraw) was the most wise decision to be made.' The investigation, published by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act, found that attempts by US military leaders to plan the evacuation of embassy staff and Afghan allies were met with resistance in the White House and the State Department. It is worth noting that in August 2021, the Taliban intensified its attacks on the Afghan government forces and entered the capital Kabul on August 15, 2021. Under the cover of night on August 31, the US military began to leave Kabul, marking the end of nearly 20 years of US military presence in the country. In early September of the same year, the Taliban formed a new government in Afghanistan.\n",

      "President Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race has been met with praise from his supporters, who see it as a selfless act that will allow his party to move forward with a new nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Michael D. Brown, a member of the US Senate shadow delegates, Biden's decision was a 'sacrifice' that showed he 'cares more about the people than he cares about himself.' However, others have questioned Biden's motivations, with Anita Dunn, his longtime adviser, attributing his change of heart to '24 days of unremitting negative, horrible attacks on Joe Biden.' Representative Nancy Pelosi said she hasn't had a conversation with Biden about his decision, but expressed her support for it, saying 'He made the decision for the country.' Representative Seth Moulton, who was one of the first lawmakers to call for Biden to withdraw, praised Biden's decision, saying 'This is an extraordinary time in American political history... Democrats have a new lease on life, not just with the presidential ticket but with every race up and down the ballot.'\n",

      "Former President Donald Trump is complaining that he has to face Vice President Kamala Harris instead of President Joe Biden in the election, claiming that the Democrats 'staged the first ever 'Coup' in America' and that Biden was 'fired' from the race. Trump has repeatedly used similar language, calling the situation a 'coup of a president' and claiming that the Democrats are a 'threat to democracy.' However, experts warn that Trump's rhetoric is setting up the 'next version of 'Stop the Steal,' a movement that pushed false claims of election fraud after the 2020 election. 'They're latching on to this, that what the Democrats just did, that's a coup,' said former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., adding that Trump's supporters believe it. 'This is what I hear all day. That was the attack on democracy. That's what they're going to do to push back on the legitimate charge that Trump tried to overthrow an election four years ago.'\n",

The insider proposed that Trump offer Kennedy a major position in his administration, such as HHS Secretary or Attorney General, in exchange for the endorsement. Kennedy's campaign manager Amaryllis Kennedy acknowledged that the campaign's impact is confined to its effect on the two frontrunners, saying 'Any path forward changes the outcome.'

The plan, which outlines how a second Trump term would operate, has drawn massive attention and criticism for its proposals to slash federal government programs, eliminate the Department of Education, and replace government experts with conservative loyalists. Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan, but many of its architects are former Trump appointees, staff, or allies.

Trump's campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement that the new additions will help Trump 'prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' However, the Democratic National Committee's rapid response director, Alex Floyd, responded by saying that Trump is 'surrounding himself with people who share his values—namely crooks, convicts, and creeps.' Trump was also asked about his campaign strategy of launching personal attacks on Harris, and he said, 'I think I am entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her.

Politico quotes 'three people familiar with Biden's thinking' and a 'senior White House official' who describe Biden's feelings towards party members, but the officials remain unnamed. The article suggests that these anonymous sources may be motivated by personal grievances, such as 'private irritation' over a recent story in The New Yorker. The author argues that if journalists are going to report on politicians' inner thoughts, they should reveal their sources to provide context and avoid speculation.

Harris has been criticized for not having her own policy proposals, but she has outlined an economic platform that draws from progressive populism. The Democratic platform also refers to Biden's 'second term,' indicating that the party is still adjusting to his withdrawal from the race. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has been trying to tie Harris to a bundle of right-wing policy proposals known as 'Project 2025,' which has been repudiated by the former president himself. However, six of Trump's former Cabinet secretaries and 140 people who worked in his administration were involved in writing the plan. Michigan state Sen.

While all members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep interest rates unchanged, there was a trend among some officials to begin easing in July rather than waiting until September.

      "A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction. \n",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation has eased, but remains above the Fed's target, and that the committee wants to see 'further progress' before lowering rates. Powell signaled that an interest rate cut is coming 'as soon as the next meeting' if inflation continues to cool and the labor market remains stable. Analysts predict a 100% probability of a September rate cut, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage point reduction. The Fed will closely monitor inflation and jobs data between now and September to determine the extent of the cut. The decision means consumers must weather high interest rates for at least a little longer, with borrowers facing record-high mortgage and credit card payments. However, interest rates remaining steady mean larger yields on certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts. The stock market has had a strong performance on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq indexes up more than 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, as investors adjust to potentially lower rates.\n",

The Fed kept its interest rate between 5.25% and 5.50%, but made significant changes to its statement, opening the door for a potential cut in the next meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, 'If we see inflation falling... roughly in line with expectations, growth continuing reasonably strong and the labor market consistent with current conditions, then I think a cut in the rate could be on the table for the September meeting.' However, recent data from the US Department of Labor showed a strong slowdown in job creation in July, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%, a post-pandemic high. This led to a surge in market volatility and some Fed officials indicating they would consider cutting rates in September. Neel Kashkari, President of the Fed of Minneapolis, said, 'The risk balance has shifted, so the debate about cutting rates in September is appropriate.' Previously, Kashkari emphasized the importance of ensuring inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target, even if that means keeping rates steady until late this year.\n",

The Fed unanimously voted to hold rates at a range between 5.25% to 5.5% at the meeting, but 'almost all' officials said that the factors that have pushed inflation down 'would likely continue' in the coming months, including the slowing economy and consumer pushback on high prices.

The Dow Jones index rose with markets anticipating greater visibility on interest rate cuts. The Fed's policy statement noted 'some further progress' towards achieving the 2% inflation target, with inflation rising 2.5% in June. The committee is shifting focus from solely fixating on inflation to being 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate' -- inflation and employment. The unemployment rate in the US has risen to 4.1%. This could have implications for emerging economies, as the International Monetary Fund noted that 'a number of central banks in emerging market economies remain cautious in regard to cutting rates owing to external risks triggered by changes in interest rate differentials and associated depreciation of those economies' currencies against the dollar.' \n",

The US interest rate has been at 5.5% since July 2023, after the Federal Reserve kept it steady for eight consecutive meetings. The data on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which will be released on August 30, and the employment report outside the agricultural sector, which will be released on September 6, will play a crucial role in the Federal Reserve's decision at its next meeting on September 17-18. Gold markets are retreating from a record high as investors await signs of a rate cut. The latest data for July was reassuring, with the economy showing signs of strength and resilience, whether it was the decline in inflation, which is gradually decreasing, despite not yet reaching the target level of 2%, or the positive numbers for the Producer Price Index (PPI) and retail sales, which were stronger than expected, or the weekly unemployment benefits, which fell for the second consecutive week. While the Federal Reserve is still holding back on cutting interest rates, major central banks have already taken this step. The Bank of Canada was the first major central bank to cut interest rates, on June 5, by 0.25% to 4.75%, and then again on July 24, by 0.25% to 4.5%. After the release of the Canadian inflation data for July yesterday, which was 2.5% in line with expectations, the Bank of Canada remains on the right track to cut interest rates for the third consecutive meeting in the coming month. The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the first time in five years on June 6, by 0.25% to 3.75%, after keeping it steady for five consecutive meetings. On August 1, the Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5%, after keeping it steady for seven consecutive meetings. The Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates twice this year, in March and June, by 0.25% each time, leaving interest rates at 1.25%. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25% on August 8, after keeping it steady for eight consecutive meetings at 5.5% since May 2023. The Swedish Riksbank cut interest rates by 0.25% to 3.5% yesterday, for the second time this year, after cutting it 0.25% also in May. According to ATFX MENA's chief market analyst, Kabi Dahdoh, the Jackson Hole conference may give some indications on the direction of the Federal Reserve. Dahdoh added in an interview with Al Arabiya Business that the employment data is the key in determining the percentage of interest rate cut. He explained that with the start of the series of interest rate cuts, investors are now monitoring the US dollar.\n",

      "The Federal Reserve's meeting minutes from July 30-31 showed that most policymakers agreed that they would likely lower the federal funds rate in September if inflation continued to decline. The minutes stated that 'the majority' of policymakers 'noted that if the data continues to appear as expected, it would be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.' The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate at 5.3% in July, which is the highest level in nearly a quarter century. Market participants have already considered it certain that the Federal Reserve will announce its first rate cut in four years when it meets on September 17-18. A rate cut by the Federal Reserve would ultimately lead to a decrease in car loan and mortgage interest rates, and could also lead to an increase in stock prices. The meeting minutes also highlighted that 'many' policymakers believe that the current interest rate stance is restrictive, while 'a few' participants argued that leaving the interest rate unchanged would increase pressure on the economy. Despite all Federal Reserve officials agreeing to keep the interest rate steady in July, the minutes noted that 'many' policymakers believed that the progress in lowering inflation, combined with rising unemployment rates, 'provided a reasonable argument for reducing the 25-basis-point target range.' The Federal Reserve maintained its monetary policy settings for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. In its policy statement, the central bank said it is 'attentive to risks on both sides of its dual mandate,' a change from its June statement, which said it was 'highly attentive' to inflation risks. Although the Federal Reserve reiterated that it does not expect to cut interest rates until it has more confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the post-meeting press conference effectively confirmed a rate cut in September. Powell said, 'We are approaching the point where we would be cutting rates,' and added that cutting interest rates might be considered in September. He also noted that there was 'a real discussion' about cutting interest rates at the July meeting. Powell's cautious comments and the soft labor market data allowed the markets to price in a 25-basis-point rate cut in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 50-basis-point rate cut had risen to nearly 50% earlier in August. With the upbeat retail sales for July and the weekly jobless claims data that eased concerns about the economic slowdown in the United States, the chances of a large rate cut of 25% have decreased.\n",

      "US stock index futures rose slightly on Wednesday evening, extending gains from Wall Street as the minutes of the Federal Reserve's recent meeting fueled growing conviction that the central bank will cut rates. The minutes showed an increasing number of policymakers supported lowering interest rates amid progress in bringing down inflation. Analysts at Citi see a 50 bps reduction as their base case for September, especially after Wednesday's minutes showed more officials leaning towards lower rates. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,620.85 points on Wednesday, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.6% to 17,817.99 points. However, gains in Wall Street were held back by anticipation of an address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, where he is expected to reiterate the central bank's dovish stance, setting the stage for a September rate cut.\n",

      "The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady at a 22-year high, between 5.25% and 5.5%, citing mixed economic data and a need for more confidence that inflation is moving towards its target of 2%. The Fed's statement suggests that it may wait longer than expected to cut rates, potentially throwing cold water on investors' expectations of a September cut. As stated by the Fed, 'The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The next scheduled meeting is in September, with potential cuts in November and December. Prior to the meeting, financial markets had predicted a 100% chance of a September cut and high odds of further cuts this year. \n",

      "Federal Reserve officials discussed cutting interest rates in July, but ultimately decided to hold them steady. However, they noted that a rate cut in September could be appropriate if the data continues to come in as expected. Since the meeting, the data have likely strengthened the case for a September rate cut, particularly after a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July 30-31 meeting stated that 'the vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.' Officials also noted that inflation was becoming less of a concern, with 'almost all participants observed that the factors that had contributed to recent disinflation would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months.' The next batch of data will arrive before the September meeting, including August jobs data on Sept. 6 and the August Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11. Interest-rate futures markets are pricing in about 62% odds of a quarter-point reduction in the fed-funds rate in September. 'Most participants remarked on the importance of communicating the Committee's data-dependent approach and emphasized, in particular, that monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path or that those decisions depend on the totality of the incoming data rather than on any particular data point,' the minutes read. 'These factors included a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic.' The softening labor market was also responsible for some of the slowing inflation by putting less upward pressure on wages. Going forward, officials were watching for developments on both the inflation and employment sides of their mandate. 'Some participants noted that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration,' the minutes read. 'As sources of upside risks to inflation, some participants cited the potential for disruptions to supply chains and a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions.' \n",

      "Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that the Fed will acknowledge progress in reducing inflation, which is a prerequisite for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, where he may be asked about the outlook for the next meeting in September and the pace of easing for the rest of the year. Some economists, including Subadra Rajappa of Societe Generale, believe that the Fed will change its language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting. 'I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,' said Rajappa. Rate Decision: All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question is how clearly the FOMC will signal this. 'We think communications from the July meeting will offer only tentative hints of a September cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting the potential for a cut 'if data evolve as we expect,' said Bloomberg Economics. 'Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,' said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.\n",

      "Most Federal Reserve officials agree that they will likely cut their benchmark interest rate in September if inflation continues to cool. The minutes of the Fed's July meeting revealed that the 'vast majority' of policymakers believe it would be 'appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting' if data continues to come in as expected. This would be the first interest rate cut in four years and could lead to lower rates for auto loans, mortgages, and other forms of consumer borrowing, as well as boost stock prices. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to provide further guidance on the Fed's next steps in a highly anticipated speech on Friday, where he may signal that the Fed has become confident that inflation is headed back to its 2% target and hint at the number of rate cuts that could happen this year.\n",

      "The Federal Reserve has voted to keep interest rates steady at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive time, but its statement suggests 'some further progress' on inflation, indicating that inflation is decreasing. Most experts predict an interest rate cut in September, which could bring relief to Americans waiting for rates to drop before taking out a new loan or mortgage, or paying off high-interest credit card debt. The Fed has been holding interest rates at a 23-year high since last summer to bring inflation down to its target of 2%.\n",

      "The Federal Reserve held its interest rate target steady at 5.25% to 5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, despite investor expectations of a potential cut in the coming months. The Fed stated that its goals for the labor market and inflation 'continue to move into better balance,' but stopped short of signaling a rate cut at the next meeting in September. The decision comes as inflation has been falling, with the consumer price index dropping to 3% for the year ending in June, a 0.3-point decline more than predicted by economists. The Fed's multiyear projections indicate that inflation will fall to 2.6% by the end of 2024 and the unemployment rate will be 4% by the end of this year. The economy has been expanding at a healthy pace, despite high-interest-rate environment, with a 1.4% growth rate in the first quarter of this year.\n",

      "Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.\n",

      "The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee stated that there has been 'some further progress' towards its 2% inflation target, citing the steady drop in inflation in recent months. This decision sets the stage for a potential rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, just before the US elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled a potential rate cut in September due to easing inflation and a cooling labor market. The committee's post-meeting statement acknowledged the moderation in job gains and the slight rise in the unemployment rate, while noting that inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' Economists and investors expect a rate cut in September, and the Fed will closely monitor labor market trends and inflation to achieve a balanced risk between inflation and employment. According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed's goal is to foster maximum employment, and the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the slowdown in hiring underscore the Fed's cautious stance. As inflation trends more favorably towards the 2% target, the September meeting is poised to be pivotal, with Powell's upcoming press conference being closely watched for further insights into the central bank's strategies.\n",

      "27484 10 Based on the information provided, the chances of the Fed holding rates steady are low. Multiple sources indicate an expected rate cut in September, given the prevailing economic data and sentiment among Fed officials.

      "27486 25 While there is some speculation about a 50 bps rate cut, the prevailing sentiment seems to favor a 25 bps reduction. The information suggests that the Fed is more likely to take a cautious approach, making a 50 bps cut less probable.\n",

      "The US inflation rate has dropped to 2.9%, the lowest it's been since March 2021. Economists like Sean Snaith and Carola Binder recall the economic changes and challenges of the past few years, including the pandemic, geopolitics, and staffing shortages. They discuss how the country's economy was 'roaring back to life' in 2021, fueled by low interest rates, rising home values, and stimulus checks, but ultimately led to a surge in inflation. The Fed raised interest rates 11 times to combat inflation, which peaked at 8.5% in 2022. Economists still debate whether inflation was transitory or not, but Betsey Stevenson believes it was, and that the key now is to find the right interest rate to keep jobs and the economy steady.

      "The inflation rate in the United States fell to 2.9% in July, the lowest since 2021, according to official data. This decrease in inflation rate has given impetus to the possibility of reducing interest rates by the Federal Reserve in September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 2.9% in annual terms, below the 3% reported in June, and the lowest level since March 2021. The CPI was slightly below the average of economists consulted by Dow Jones, Newswires, and The Wall Street Journal. However, prices increased by 0.2% in the monthly comparison with June, when they were 0.1%. This trend corresponds to the expectations of analysts, according to the MarketWatch consensus. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes volatile products such as food and energy, was 3.2% in annual terms, also in line with market expectations and a slight decline from the previous month (3.3%). US President Joe Biden celebrated the 'progress' in the fight against inflation. 'There is still work to be done to reduce costs for American workers, but we have made real progress, with wages increasing more rapidly than prices over the past 17 months,' he highlighted in a statement. The decrease in inflation is mainly due to the decline in prices of vehicles, new and used, and to a lesser extent, clothing and fuels. Services, excluding energy, the main drivers of inflation, increased in the monthly comparison: 0.3% in July compared to 0.1% in June. The largest increases were in housing and transportation. 'The housing data are a bit disappointing and continue to be a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve,' estimated Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, in a note. 'The high prices of housing seem persistent, but with a reduction in other sectors, the Fed has a green light to reduce rates by 25 points' in its next meeting, he said. In summary, the trend of increasing prices indicates that the long-term goal of 2% in annual terms set by the Federal Reserve could be achieved. 'We do not observe a sharp drop in prices, as would be expected in the case of an economic collapse,' highlighted the economists of HFE in a note. 'Who expects to see three rate cuts by the Fed will not find anything in these data that can confirm them.' The financial markets panicked on August 5 due to an unexpected increase in interest rates by the Bank of Japan and fears of a recession in the US economy, following the release of disappointing data. US economic activity shows clear signs of deceleration after almost two years of exceptional growth, but so far, there are no signs of a potential recession despite a slight increase in unemployment last month. So far, the institution has refused to reduce interest rates, considering that it still does not have data that demonstrates that this goal will be achievable and sustainable in the long term. The United States recorded a peak inflation rate of 9.5% in terms of homologous in June 2022, after the global economy reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve responded by increasing interest rates, which rose to a range between 5.25% and 5.50%, its highest level since the beginning of the century. \n",
      "\n",
      "The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2% in July, in line with expectations, and confirms that inflationary pressures are easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI increased by 0.2% in July, after a 0.1% decline in June. Over the past 12 months, the CPI has risen by 2.9%, a slight decrease from the 3.0% annual increase recorded in June. Economists had predicted a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.0% annual increase. These data follow a report published on Tuesday indicating a slight increase in production prices for the month of July. The moderation of annual CPI growth from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 suggests that inflation is approaching the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The Fed must now make a decision on interest rates at its next meeting on September 17-18, with market expectations divided between a 0.5% rate cut and a 25 basis point reduction. This indecision is partly due to the fact that the unemployment rate has reached its highest level in three years, at 4.3%, in July. Despite the rise in unemployment, which has increased for four consecutive months, economists suggest that a significant deterioration in the labor market would be necessary for the central bank to consider a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut. They attribute the rise in unemployment primarily to an increase in labor supply due to immigration, rather than an increase in layoffs. The Fed's daily reference interest rate has remained stable in the 5.25% to 5.50% range for a year, after being raised by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Excluding the most volatile components, such as food and energy, the core CPI also rose by 0.2% in July, representing a slight increase from the 0.1% increase recorded in June. The core CPI over 12 months rose by 3.2% in July, representing the lowest annual increase since April 2021, and a decline from the 3.3% increase recorded in June.\n",

      "According to La Bancaria, the union that represents bank employees, the recent paritaria agreement in August 2024 will result in a 4% increase in salaries for bank workers, equivalent to the inflation rate in July. This increase will be applied to the salaries of June, and the difference between the accumulated inflation from January to July 2024 (87%) and the increments already granted in 2024 will also be paid. La Bancaria stated, 'We guarantee the application of monthly inflation indices so that bank workers do not lose against inflation, safeguarding the purchasing power of our representatives.' This increase affects all monthly gross, normal, habitual, and total remunerations, including conventional and non-conventional additional payments. To determine the exact amount, the calculation will be applied to the June income. The inflation rate in July was 4%, which is the lowest rate so far this year, according to the Indec.

The core inflation rate also increased by 0.2% (month-over-month) and 3.2% (year-over-year), matching the predicted values. The SRI (Seasonally Adjusted Rate of Inflation) for the US without rounding was 0.155% (overall) and 0.165% (core). According to Neomarkets, the market's expectations for a decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rates have slightly increased after the inflation reports, but there are no significant changes. The probability of four interest rate cuts by the end of the year remains, and the chances of a 0.50% interest rate cut in September are increasing. However, weak non-farm employment data could significantly increase the expectations for the rate of interest rate cuts this year, unlike inflation, which has no current impact.\n",

      "Consumer prices rose 2.9% in July compared to a year ago, the lowest level since 2021. This marks the fifth consecutive month of slowing inflation, with prices cooling significantly from a peak of over 9%. Despite this, inflation remains 1% higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%. The latest data will ease pressure on consumers, but prices remain 20% higher than three years ago. Food prices increased 2.2% and energy prices 1.1%, while prices for rice, flour, and fish fell. However, egg prices soared 19%. The Fed may reduce interest rate cuts in September, depending on economic performance, according to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Powell said, 'For a long time, since inflation arrived, it's been right to mainly focus on inflation. But now that inflation has come down and the labor market has indeed cooled off, we're going to be looking at both mandates. They're in much better balance.' \n",

This is the lowest inflation rate since March 2021, increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that prices increased by 0.2% compared to June. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, also decreased by 0.1% annually to 3.2%, and increased by 0.2% monthly. US President Joe Biden celebrated the data, but lamented that 'prices are still too high: large corporations are accumulating record profits and are not doing enough to lower prices.' Biden stated, 'Today's data shows that we are making progress in the fight against inflation and reducing costs for American households.' The BLS noted that the housing index increased in July (0.4% monthly), contributing to more than 90% of the monthly increase in prices of all items. Housing has accumulated an annual increase of 5.1%. Energy prices remained stable after decreases in the previous two periods and have accumulated a 1.1% increase in the last 12 months, while food prices increased by 0.2% in July, with an annual increase of 2.2%. The gasoline index also remained stable in July and has accumulated a 2.2% decrease in the last year. With this, inflation has accumulated four consecutive decreases since the March data, which was 3.5%. The Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates since July 2023 at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, its highest level since 2001, after eleven increases initiated in March 2022. All eyes are now on the Fed's monthly meeting scheduled between September 17 and 18, where a first rate cut is expected.

The report also states that the country is facing an 'acute recession in 2024' and that the economy will contract by 3.4% in 2024. As stated in the report, 'our consensus is that there will be more contractions in the second quarter, and the latest data suggests risks of a deeper contraction.'

The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also increased by 0.2% in the seventh month of 2024, after registering 0.1% in June. Both results were in line with market expectations of a 0.2% increase. In the 12-month accumulation, the CPI in July rose 3%, the same growth recorded in June and in line with market projections. On an annual basis, the core inflation rate was 3.2%, within expectations and decelerating from the 3.3% recorded in June, according to Globo.com.\n",

      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 0.2% growth in headline CPI for July, up from June's -0.1%, and a 0.2% growth in core CPI, accelerating from June's 0.1%. On a year-over-year basis, headline CPI slowed from 3.0% growth to 2.9%, while core CPI printed at 3.2%, down from 3.3%. The author of the article, Guilfoyle, questions the accuracy of the report, citing examples of health insurance prices being down 0.4% month over month and down 0.6% year over year, while his own health insurer has informed him of a double-digit increase for 2025. Guilfoyle believes that the report does not change the narrative that the FOMC will cut short-term interest rates on September 18, 2024, and that the economy will slow down, potentially leading to a recession. He also notes that the market is pricing in a high probability of rate cuts, but warns that this may not be good for equities once the recession is recognized and the unemployment rate rises above 5%.\n",

      "US equity indices and the ASX 200 experienced a volatile week due to concerns of a US recession and the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance on interest rates. The RBA's Governor Michele Bullock warned that the RBA is ready to raise rates to combat persistently high inflation. Despite this, the Australian interest rates market is skeptical about the RBA's rate hike, with a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut almost fully priced before year-end. Key economic indicators for the week ahead include the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) interest rate decision, and the Australian labour force report. In the US, headline inflation decreased by 0.1% month-on-month (MoM) in June, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 3.0% year-on-year (YoY). The core inflation rate for June increased by 0.1%, leading to an annual rate of 3.3%. For July, headline inflation is expected to rise by 0.2% MoM, with the annual rate holding steady at 3.0% YoY. Core inflation is also expected to increase by 0.2% MoM, with the annual core rate predicted to soften to 3.2% YoY. In China, retail sales underperformed in June, coming in at 2.0% versus the 3.3% expected. The big miss in retail sales continues to reflect sluggish domestic demand. Trade data and Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figures have been mixed, failing to provide assurances for a more sustained recovery just yet. Overall, there are some doubts about whether China will be able to achieve its growth target of 5% in 2024, especially since China's 2Q GDP dipped to 4.7%.\n",

The year-over-year inflation rate is 3.2%, down from 3.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in 21 months. The trimmed mean, a core measure of inflation, shows a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3% year-over-year increase, down from 0.3% and 3.2% respectively. This data comes ahead of the official quarterly CPI release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on July 31, which may impact the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on interest rates at its next meeting on August 5-6.\n",

Shelter prices, which have been a major contributor to inflation, rose by 0.2% MoM, their smallest gain since August 2021. While prices increased in some areas, such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care, they fell in others, like airfares and used cars. The report suggests that core inflation will continue to moderate this year, and the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September. The data supports the view that the economy and labor market are becoming more balanced, which could lead to a rate cut.\n",

      "The US inflation rate has fallen below 3% for the first time since March 2021, with the CPI index reaching 2.9% in July. The PPI index increased by 2.2%. The publication of US retail sales data, which rose by 1% in July against an expected 0.4%, has also reduced the prospects of a near-term recession. The US unemployment claims have decreased below those of the previous week, confirming the scenario of a soft landing for the US economy. The US technology stocks, which have been battered in recent weeks, have rebounded strongly, with the Tech component of the S&P 500 rising by 7.6% over the week. The euro has appreciated by 1.03% against the US dollar over the week. The CAC 40 has gained 2.5%, the S&P 500 has risen by 3.9% (its best week of 2024) and the Nasdaq has surged by 5.3%. The German ZEW investor sentiment index has deteriorated in August, falling to 19.2, its lowest level in two years. In China, the youth unemployment rate has risen to 17.1% in July, its highest level since December 2023. The publication of earnings reports for Applied Materials, Deere, and On Holding have exceeded expectations, while Home Depot's earnings have also exceeded expectations, but the company has revised its full-year guidance downwards due to a decline in demand for home improvement projects. The market will be watching the annual symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, which starts on August 22, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak on Friday. The announcement of a rate cut in September seems likely, but investors will be looking for clues on the configuration of future rate cuts. The Democratic convention will take place on August 19 and 22, and the minutes of the last Fed meeting will be released on Wednesday, as well as the US PMI data on Thursday. 'We have maintained our positions and benefited from the rebound of this week,' said the article. 'A scenario similar to that of 1995, where the S&P 500 surged by 40% in the 18 months following the first rate cut by Alan Greenspan, is not excluded, even if the S&P 500 is already flirting with its highs.'

      "The AIER Business Conditions indicators for June 2024 showed mixed results, with the Leading Indicator at 54, the Roughly Coincident Indicator at 83, and the Lagging Indicator at 42. The Leading Indicator rose in seven components, fell in two, and remained neutral in three. The Roughly Coincident Indicator rose in five components and declined in one. The Lagging Indicator declined in four components, rose in one, and remained neutral in one. The substantial divergence among the three indices suggests ambiguity rather than clarity. However, the Lagging Indicator has provided the most accurate reflection of underlying economic conditions. Recent data indicates a labor market slowdown, with applications for US unemployment benefits surging to their highest point in nearly a year. The July 2024 Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing survey showed a steep drop in the employment component to 43.4, the lowest level since June 2020. The decline in industrial production and manufacturing output, as well as the drop in consumer goods production, signal weak factory output. The Empire State and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys for August 2024 reinforced indications of a softening in activity, with declines in employment metrics. The consumer side shows a cautious environment, with a 0.3 percent gain in the control group's modest retail sales, and a 0.4 percent deceleration in sales excluding autos and gasoline. Recent inflation data suggest progress in the Federal Reserve's disinflation efforts, with the June Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index and several months of core inflation prints roughly aligned with the Fed's 2 percent target. However, the combination of July's CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) data imply an acceleration in the core PCE deflator on both monthly and annual bases. The activation of the Sahm Rule suggests that the United States has either entered, or is on the verge, of entering a recession.\n",

      "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics announced a slowdown in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July 2024, with an annual increase of 2.9%, lower than expected and lower than the previous month's data. The CPI is a broad measure of the cost of goods and services. The main CPI index showed an annual increase of 2.9% in July, lower than the expected 3%, and the previous month's reading was 3%. On a monthly basis, the main inflation index rose by 0.2%, as expected, while the index fell by 0.1% in June. The core CPI (excluding food and energy) showed an annual increase of 3.2% in July, as expected, and the previous month's reading was 3.3%. On a monthly basis, the core inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, as expected, and the previous month's reading was 0.1%. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 'the slowdown in inflation is a positive sign for the US economy.' \n",

      "The June CPI inflation expectations are expected to show a rise in inflation, despite the slowing economy. The core CPI is predicted to increase by 0.2% MoM and 3.4% YoY, while the headline CPI is expected to increase by 0.1% MoM and 3.1% YoY. The annual core CPI inflation at 3.4% would match the lowest annual core inflation reading from last month, May 2024. The headline core CPI at 3.1% would be below the 3.3% level in May, but still above the cyclical low of 3% annual CPI inflation number from June 2023. The disinflationary process has stalled, and the monthly core CPI inflation readings over the last 12 months suggest that the core annual CPI inflation has either stalled at 3.4% for the next three months or it could even start rising. The InflationNowcast by Cleveland Fed predicts that June core CPI will come at 0.28%, or rounded to 0.3%, which would be an upside surprise, above the 0.2% consensus expectations. The annual CPI inflation is predicted to rise over the next 2 months, and the core CPI is predicted to rise to 3.6% by July, and the headline CPI is expected to rise to 3.2% by July. The July inflation data will be reported in August, right before the Fed's September meeting. If these predictions are correct, the Fed will not be able to cut interest rates in September, as the market currently expects.\n",

      "The US economy's soft or hard landing has been a topic of discussion due to changing data. The S&P 500 plummeted over 6% between August 4 and 6 after the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July. Many analysts questioned the soft landing, but the data shows that the unemployment rate increased by 0.8 percentage points in a year, from 3.5% in July 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024. However, the Sham rule, which predicts a recession when the average unemployment rate over the last three months exceeds its 12-month minimum by 0.5 percentage points, is being followed. The average unemployment rate increase observed in the last three months is 0.53 percentage points. Although the indicator observed in July barely exceeds the rule, economist Michael Strain notes that 'when the unemployment rate goes up a little, it goes up a lot, which is why many believe the Fed should declare victory in its battle against inflation and start its cycle of rate cuts. However, this view is wrong, as it misreads the inflation perspective and the labor market.' The Fed is expected to wait for the July inflation rate, which is the key rate that follows, corresponding to the 12-month variation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding fuels and food, which had registered 2.6% in May and June, the lowest since March 2021. The two presidential candidates, Trump and Harris, have positioned themselves on the economic theme, with Trump prioritizing the fight against immigration and only in point 3, 'ending inflation and making the US affordable again.' Harris has presented her economic agenda, prioritizing building an 'opportunity economy' for the middle class, and has committed to stopping the price increases of products like food and combating price speculation. She proposes a federal ban on abusive price increases in the food industry and 'new sanctions for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules.'\n",

Therefore, the most probable outcome for August 2024 is a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI inflation.\n",
      "27488 10 The likelihood of core CPI inflation being 0.0% or less appears low given the recent data and trends.

      "27489 25 A 0.1% increase is possible, but less likely than a 0.2% increase given recent trends. At 0.1%, it would represent a deceleration from the July figure and suggest a cooling inflation environment. Based on the data, this is less likely but still within the realm of possibility.\n",
      "27490 50 A 0.2% increase is the most likely outcome given the recent trend and current data. The pattern of July's increase aligns with similar monthly increases, making this the median prediction.\n",

Grossi stated that he was 'personally in contact with the relevant authorities of both countries' and would 'continue to update the international community as appropriate'.

Chemizov suggested recalling the first atomic bomb and the nuclear strikes by the American army on civilian population in Japan in 1945, which he called 'completely senseless'. He noted that the US wanted to demonstrate their dominance, which led to the Cold War and an arms race with the USSR. Chemizov emphasized that the current degradation is 'threatening' and pointed out that the world is 'sliding back' into a path of degradation, despite making significant progress in technology.

Hruby noted that in October 2023, the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, saying, 'We expect the first B61-13 unit to be produced in 2026.' The NNSA Administrator added that the budget required for strategic stability programs will be around $25 billion, including $21 billion for nuclear weapons. According to Hruby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' as the world fights climate change, and she stated that 'in this case, high-assay low-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors.'

      "China has expressed concern over a new American nuclear strategy targeting it. According to a report by the New York Times, US President Joe Biden approved a secret nuclear strategy in March, which for the first time directs American deterrence towards China, focusing on China's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal. The strategy also aims to prepare the US for potential coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said, 'The US is promoting the narrative of a Chinese nuclear threat and finding excuses for gaining a strategic advantage.' She added, 'The facts have proven that the US has been constantly stirring up the so-called Chinese nuclear threat theory in recent years.' The US has been updating its nuclear strategy every four years, and it is highly classified, with only a few printed copies distributed to national security officials and defense leaders. In June, the US National Security Council's director for arms control and non-proliferation, Berne Fadi, mentioned the document, which for the first time examines whether the US is ready to respond to simultaneous or sequential nuclear crises using a mix of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. Fadi said the new strategy confirms 'the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea at the same time.' The White House stated that the secret nuclear strategy approved by Biden this year is not a response to a specific country or threat, but rather a constant US concern about China's nuclear expansion. According to a Pentagon report released in October 2023, China's nuclear arsenal currently includes over 500 active nuclear warheads, which is expected to increase to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, numbers also reported by the US and Russia.\n",

      "According to The New York Times, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategy plan in March that reorients the country's disuasive strategy to focus on China's rapid nuclear arsenal expansion. The plan, which is updated every four years, also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. The NYT reported that the document is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear threats. The NYT noted that the possibility of adversaries coordinating nuclear threats to surpass the US nuclear arsenal seemed remote in the past, but explained that the 'emerging association' between Russia and China and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine have changed Washington's thinking. The change is also attributed to China's nuclear ambitions. China's nuclear expansion is advancing at a faster pace than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous estimates, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The Department of Defense's annual report on China's military power calculated that China's nuclear arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its army is 'basically complete' by then. The NYT also reported that Washington is concerned about the paralysis of talks with China on nuclear security improvements. There was an exchange on the topic between the two countries last fall, but from Beijing, it has been suggested, according to the NYT, that there is no interest in continuing the talks. As stated by The New York Times, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students.' \n",

This is the first time the US has provided such information since October 2021. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) reported that between 1994 and 2023, Washington has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads. Additionally, around 2000 warheads are currently being decommissioned. The US has reduced its non-strategic (tactical) nuclear arsenal by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The NNSA emphasized the importance of transparency in nuclear arsenals for efforts to prevent the spread and disarmament of nuclear weapons, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia and the US remain the world's largest nuclear powers, accounting for around 90% of the world's nuclear arsenal. The US has deployed nuclear weapons in five NATO countries under the protection of the US Air Force, with a total of around 100 warheads, consisting entirely of gravity bombs B61. The US regularly speaks about the nuclear threat posed by other countries, including Russia's alleged plans to deploy similar weapons in space.

Instead, they suggest reverting to flight tasks that were abolished by Boris Yeltsin in 1994. The 'zero flight task' is a document signed by Russia, the US, and the UK in 1994, which states that systems guiding nuclear-capable missiles on standby do not contain target coordinates, or if they do, the coordinates are a remote point on the Earth's surface. This prevents damage in the event of an accidental or unintended launch. The document was signed during a visit by US President Bill Clinton to Moscow in 1994, where a declaration was made to refuse to target each other's strategic nuclear missiles. Russia's Yeltsin said, 'I have made a decision. All that is targeted at countries led by those sitting at the table... will be removed.' However, it was later revealed that Yeltsin made the decision unilaterally and without discussion with Russian delegation members.

      "US President Joe Biden has approved a top-secret nuclear strategic plan that redirects Washington's strategy to deter the expansion of China's nuclear arsenal. The plan, titled 'Guidelines for the Use of Nuclear Weapons,' is the first to address the possibility of responding to nuclear crises that erupt simultaneously or sequentially with a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. According to Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the new strategy takes into account the 'significant increase in size and diversity' of China's nuclear arsenal. The document emphasizes the need to simultaneously deter Russia, China, and North Korea. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia is helping the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return for conventional weapons. The new document is a stark reminder that the next president will face a changed and far more volatile nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. 'It was an important moment,' said Richard Haas, a former senior State Department and National Security Council official, referring to a crisis in October 2022 when Biden and his aides feared that the possibility of using nuclear weapons could rise to 50% or more.\n",

      "The United States has revealed the number of its strategic nuclear warheads, which stood at 3,748 as of September 2023. This is the first time the data has been made public since October 2021. The Federation of American Scientists stated that the nuclear arsenal will consist of 3,708 warheads in 2024. Additionally, the number of non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons in the US has decreased by more than 90% since September 1991. According to the National Nuclear Security Administration, the US had 3,748 nuclear warheads intended for strategic forces as of September 2023.\n",

      "The United States has published recently declassified information about its nuclear arsenal to update the information last announced in October 2021. The document was published on the website of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and became known on July 20. According to the document, as of September 2023, the US had 3748 nuclear warheads in storage. This number is after a reduction of 88% compared to the maximum value of 31,255 at the end of the 1967 fiscal year and an additional reduction of 83% compared to the level after the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989. The US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023. From September 30, 2020, the US dismantled 405 nuclear warheads. Approximately 2,000 nuclear warheads are currently being removed from service and awaiting dismantling, according to the document. The US has reduced its non-strategic nuclear weapons by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that the nuclear stockpile includes both active and inactive warheads. Active warheads include strategic and non-strategic weapons that are maintained in a working, ready-to-use form and logistical reserves. Inactive warheads are stored on the shelf in a non-working state and their tritium balloons are removed.\n",

      "The Indian Navy accidentally revealed the removal of nuclear weapons from a ship in a yoga post on Instagram. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) used social media to track the movement of India's nuclear arsenal. According to Matt Korda, Associate Director of the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, 'This is probably the most unexpected source I've found for information related to nuclear weapons.' Korda discovered that India had removed its nuclear weapons from two patrol boats, the INS Suvarna and the INS Subhadra, by reviewing satellite images and searching for keywords on social media. The removal of the nuclear weapons was confirmed by two yoga posts on Instagram, one from October 2022 and another from February 2024, which showed the absence of the stabilizers required for launching nuclear missiles. 'It's a bit unusual to learn about military systems, especially nuclear systems, in non-military environments,' Korda said. 'This case is unique because it shows that even in a non-military context, information about nuclear systems can be revealed.' \n",

      "The Pentagon received over 200 new nuclear weapons in 2023, according to Dr. Lisa Hrooby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration. She stated, 'As a result of the investments made under the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the nuclear security administration was able to deliver more than 200 new nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense last year. This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War.' Hrooby also mentioned that the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, the B61-13, in October 2023, and expects the first unit to be produced in 2026. The budget required for strategic stability programs, including nuclear arms, is estimated to be around $25 billion, with $21 billion allocated for nuclear weapons. According to Hrooby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' as the US fights climate change, and the high-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors. However, she believes that this will pose a challenge to the current non-proliferation regime that the US relies on.\n",

      "The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has accused Israel of lacking transparency in its nuclear program, including its possession and spending on nuclear weapons. Israel has maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity since the 1960s, and ICAN's coordinator, Susi Snyder, stated that Israel spent $1.1 billion on nuclear weapons in 2023, but has not disclosed details of these expenditures. Snyder also pointed out that 9 countries possess nuclear weapons and spent $91.4 billion on them in 2023 alone. She emphasized that nuclear weapons pose a global threat that transcends borders, and that their elimination requires international cooperation and the implementation of international agreements, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Snyder called on Israel to increase transparency in its nuclear program, considering it 'beneficial to the world' in addressing nuclear challenges and ensuring international peace and security. In October 2023, Israeli MP Rivka Frydman, from the Likud party, called for the use of 'the nuclear sword of the apocalypse' against Gaza and its destruction. \n",

      "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, is planning to visit Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant next week, according to an agency spokesperson. This comes weeks after Ukraine launched a surprise counteroffensive in the region. The IAEA had previously urged Russia and Ukraine to exercise 'maximum restraint' to 'avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences'. Grossi stated that he was 'personally in contact with the relevant authorities of both countries' and would 'continue to update the international community as appropriate'. The power plant has six units, with two in shutdown, two fully operational, and two under construction. The IAEA has regularly warned of the risk Russia's invasion of Ukraine poses to nuclear plants, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has come under repeated attacks.\n",

      "US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategy plan in March, which reorients the US disuasive strategy to focus on China's rapid nuclear arsenal expansion. The plan also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. According to The New York Times, the document updates approximately every four years and is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear arms. The New York Times noted that it is expected to be reported to Congress before Biden leaves office after the November 5 elections. The change in strategy is attributed to the emerging association between Russia and China and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine. China's nuclear ambitions are also a factor, with its nuclear expansion advancing at a faster rate than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of Washington and Moscow's arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October last year that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous predictions, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The Department of Defense's annual report on Chinese military power, published at the request of Congress, estimated that China's arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its Army is 'basically complete' by then. The report also highlighted that China considers its 'limitless' association with Russia to be fundamental to advancing its development and emergence as a great power.\n",

As of September 2023, the US had 3,748 nuclear warheads. Since 1994, the US has destroyed over 12,000 nuclear warheads. Additionally, another 2,000 are planned for disposal. The number of non-strategic, or tactical, nuclear weapons in the US has decreased by approximately 90% since September 1991. According to NNSA, 'increasing transparency of nuclear arsenals is necessary for efforts to prevent the spread and disarmament of nuclear weapons, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.' This is the first time the US has released such information since October 2021, when there were 3,750 nuclear warheads.\n",

      "Forecast 10\n",
      "Rationale Based on the information provided, the chances of the Fed holding rates steady are low. Multiple sources indicate an expected rate cut in September, given the prevailing economic data and sentiment among Fed officials. The consensus among economists, as well as market indications, strongly support a cut rather than maintaining rates. \n",

      "Forecast 10\n",
      "Rationale Rationale: The probability of Russia detonating a nuclear weapon in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory before October 1, 2024, remains low for several reasons. Firstly, doing so would significantly damage Russia's international standing and could lead to severe geopolitical consequences. Putin and other Russian officials have expressed that nuclear weapons would only be used in extreme circumstances, primarily as a last resort to protect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. While there are numerous reports of threats and the potential for nuclear provocation, these are primarily focused on creating an atmosphere of fear rather than actual intent to deploy nuclear weapons. Additionally, the timeframe until October 1, 2024, is rather short for such an extreme escalation given the current conditions of the conflict. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring before the specified date is assessed to be 10%. \n",
