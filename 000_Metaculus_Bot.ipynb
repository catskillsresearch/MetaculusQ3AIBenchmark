      "27913 75 Lisa's \"Rockstar\" has significant momentum with four nominations at the VMAs, making her the most nominated K-pop artist this year. The song's strong performance metrics and Lisa’s high-profile solo activities bolster her chances. However, strong competition from Jungkook and Stray Kids, who also have substantial fanbases, prevents a higher probability. Given all factors, a 75% likelihood seems reasonable.\n",
      "FORECASTING Catalent, Inc. 10-K filing\n",
      "27911 75 Catalent has already missed its original filing deadline, but the notification was just on August 29, 2024, giving them another 30 days. The company states that they don't expect any material changes, which suggests that the issues might not be overly complex to resolve within the available extended timeframe. Thus, there is a reasonable probability they will file on time, although the situation remains uncertain due to potential procedural delays.\n",
      "FORECASTING Edmundo González liberty status\n",
      "27919 80 Given the current political climate in Venezuela, including the arrest warrants, increased detentions of opposition figures, and Edmundo González's high-profile status, there is a high likelihood that he will be deprived of his liberty before October 1, 2024. The government's efforts to silence opposition, along with González's recent lawful defiance and continuous hiding, place him at significant risk of being detained or arrested imminently. The international condemnation, while prominent, may not be sufficient to deter the Venezuelan authorities from executing the arrest warrant within the 27-day window.\n",
      "FORECASTING Amazon layoffs\n",
      "27912 80 Given the significant number of layoffs announced by major companies, including Amazon, and the pattern of ongoing layoffs in the tech industry, it is highly plausible that new Amazon layoffs will be reported by Tech Crunch before the specified end date. Amazon's recent strategic moves, including cost-cutting measures and structural changes, further support this likelihood.\n",
      "FORECASTING 2024 Emmy Awards\n",
      "27914 70 Given that The Bear has received a record 23 nominations for a comedy series, it suggests strong support from the Television Academy. Additionally, the show has critical acclaim and considerable momentum. However, there are other strong contenders like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Only Murders in the Building, so while The Bear is a leading contender, it is not a certainty.\n",
      "FORECASTING Starliner Calypso undocking\n",
      "27918 97 Given the consistent reporting from multiple credible sources, NASA and Boeing plan for an uncrewed Starliner Calypso undocking on September 6. This is well within the September 16 deadline. The high historical reliability of such prepared schedules and the thoroughness of Nasa's preparatory processes gives me strong confidence this will occur as planned.\n"
