      "Labour MP Chris Bryant has sparked a debate by suggesting that the current parliament has reached its sell-by date. However, others have taken it a step further, with some calling it the 'worst parliament in history'. The author argues that this is an exaggeration and that there have been worse parliaments in the past, such as the Addled Parliament of 1614 and the Deadlocked Parliament of 2017-19. The author also questions the idea of judging parliaments as good or bad, and instead suggests that it is unfair to blame the current government for the failings of previous administrations. The author notes that recency bias is a problem, with people tending to think that the politicians they have now are uniquely awful. A recent Ipsos poll found that people's opinions of prime ministers are influenced by recency bias, with each prime minister being judged to have been worse than their predecessor. The author concludes that it doesn't matter whether we take parliaments or governments as our unit of analysis, and that the current parliament is likely to face an unforgiving mood by the time it faces the voters.\n",

      "Labour's new policies, such as tax increases and the abolition of the winter fuel allowance, have been implemented without being mentioned in the party's manifesto or during the election campaign. This has led to accusations of dishonesty and a lack of trust in the government. Labour's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted that taxes will have to rise, despite previously promising not to do so. The party has also been accused of reneging on its promises, such as the nationalisation of energy and water companies. The article argues that Labour's actions are a demonstration of its true colours and that the party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is not as trustworthy as he claimed to be during the election campaign. The article also notes that Labour's approval ratings are plummeting and that the party is already unloved by the public.\n",

      "Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has surpassed the Conservative Party in national Westminster voting intention, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by Omnisis, showed that Reform's support rose from 14.7% to 21%, while the Tories fell by over four points to 20%. Meanwhile, the Labour Party saw its support drop by six points to 33% amid criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's handling of recent riots. Reform UK's chief whip, Lee Anderson, said that the poll shows 'buyer's remorse' over voting for Labour and that Reform is 'eating into the Labour vote now.' However, an analysis by Stats for Lefties predicts that Labour would still pick up 18 more seats, while the Conservatives would lose 50 seats, and Reform would secure 29 seats.\n",

      "Keir Starmer's favourability ratings have returned to pre-election levels, with 53% of Britons having an unfavourable view of the new prime minister and 37% having a favourable view, giving a net favourability score of -16. This is a decrease from his high watermark of Â±0 two weeks in, when 44% of Britons had favourable and unfavourable opinions of the Labour leader. In contrast, Tony Blair's approval ratings remained consistently above his pre-election figure for two years after his landslide win in 1997. While 76% of 2024 Labour voters still have a favourable opinion of Starmer, this is the lowest score to date, having fallen from a high of 87% immediately following the election. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage's ratings have also fallen, with 25% of Britons having a favourable opinion of him and 67% having an unfavourable view, giving a net favourability score of -42. Farage now holds a negative rating among every group of the British public, including Leave voters, who score him -4, down from +7 last week.\n",

Chris Jarvis, Head of Strategy and Development at Left Foot Forward, notes that the Conservatives' stagnating support suggests they will not return to government soon.

Conversely, only 14% think he is doing a bad job. The Government as a whole also enjoys high approval ratings, with 34% saying it is running the country well. Enthusiasm for Labour is particularly high among those aged 18-34. However, Mr. Pedley notes that time will tell how long these ratings last, and the Government's ability to deliver against public priorities will dictate their fortunes in the long term.\n",

      "The approval rating of newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reached its lowest point since the parliamentary elections, according to a survey by Savanta, as reported by The Telegraph. The survey found that the rating dropped significantly after the start of the mass protests in the country. 'Given the spread of riots across the UK, his popularity among the population has become the lowest since the elections', said Chris Hopkins, director of political research at Savanta. The highest rating of the current Prime Minister was recorded on July 28, a day before the start of the riots. By August 4, the ratings had significantly decreased, and the proportion of Britons who do not approve of Starmer's policy has increased. The protests were sparked by a stabbing incident in Southport, where a teenager attacked children during a dance and yoga class, resulting in the deaths of three children and two adults. The incident led to the spread of information that the suspect was a refugee, which triggered protests in several British cities. Supporters of the extreme right-wing organization 'English Defence League' clashed with police during a protest in Southport. The British Prime Minister had previously canceled his vacation due to the unrest in the country.\n",

      "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted to 3% after a series of violent far-right protests across the country. The protests, which began in response to the killing of three children and injuring of 10 others in Southport, have been widely criticized. Starmer has been accused of not taking sufficient action to address the situation. The protests have also been sparked by the government's decision to reduce free fuel payments, which has seen the Labour Party's approval ratings drop to -12%. The protests have been marked by violent clashes between far-right groups and police, with several shops having their windows smashed and police officers injured. Starmer has condemned the violence, calling it 'the lawlessness of the far-right' and warning that those involved will face the law. He also called on social media companies to take action to prevent the spread of violence online, saying 'it is a crime to promote violence online, it is not freedom of expression.' \n",

      "A recent poll by Opinium shows that the public approves of the government's handling of the social unrest that broke out this summer, including its pursuit of those inciting racial hatred and violence online. However, the poll also shows that Keir Starmer's personal approval ratings have fallen back to pre-election levels, with a net approval rating of -7%. The public is split over Starmer's government's performance, with 24% feeling more positive and 29% feeling more negative. The poll also found that 43% of voters approve of the government's handling of the riots, while 30% disapprove. Additionally, 67% of voters believe it is fair to arrest people for inciting racial hatred on social media, and 68% back the arrest of those inciting violence on social media. 'The idea that condemning rioters was somehow saying concerns about the level of immigration were illegitimate was always a lie,' said Adam Drummond, head of political and social at Opinium. 'Strong majorities agree with Keir Starmer's description of the rioters as 'thugs', think that the prison sentences being handed out are appropriate or don't go far enough, and think it's fair to arrest people for inciting racial hatred on social media.' \n",

      "British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted by 16 points in the past two weeks, according to a survey by Opinium. The decline comes amid criticism of his handling of anti-mass migration uprisings and the decision to cut winter fuel benefits. Starmer's net approval rating has fallen to 3%, down from 19% two weeks ago. The Labour Party prime minister has faced backlash over his handling of the recent mass stabbing in Southport, which led to riots and mass protests across the country. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has also seen her approval rating collapse, with a decline of 23% in just two weeks, following the decision to cut winter fuel subsidies for pensioners. According to James Crouch of Opinium, 'scrapping universal winter fuel payments has not been a popular decision, and appears to have contributed to the Chancellor's plummet in approval ratings.'\n",

      "A video claiming to show a bar owner throwing out the current British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, from a pub has gone viral on X. However, a fact-check by NewsMeter found the claim to be misleading. The video is actually from 2021, when Boris Johnson was the Prime Minister, and shows an incident where Keir Starmer was thrown out of a pub in Bath by an anti-lockdown landlord. According to reports by the Independent and BBC, the incident occurred on April 19, 2021, during Starmer's campaign visit to Bath. The landlord asked Starmer to leave due to a lockdown row. NewsMeter found a similar post by an X account 'The First' from April 20, 2021, which also shows the same video. Hence, the claim that the current British PM was thrown out of a pub is misleading, and the video is old.\n",

Labour's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted that taxes will have to rise, despite promising 'no additional tax rises' during the campaign. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has been accused of duplicity and dishonesty, and his approval ratings are plummeting. Labour's policies are being driven by a 'Â£22 billion black hole' in the public finances, but this is disputed by experts. The party's actions are being seen as a betrayal of trust and integrity, and the public is likely to become increasingly disillusioned with Labour's government.\n",

      "Senior Tories have accused Keir Starmer of losing control of public sector pay by agreeing deals to end strikes. James Cleverly said the prime minister is being 'played by union paymasters' in making offers to train drivers and junior doctors. Chris Philp accused Labour of losing control of pay deals, saying all unions would demand double-digit rises. However, Nick Thomas-Symonds, a Cabinet Office minister, said the government is 'sticking to the promises we made in opposition' in its deals with public sector workers. The deal to end the train strikes includes a 5% increase for 2019-2022, 4.75% for 2022-2024, and a further 4.5% for 2024-2025. Thomas-Symonds said it was unfair to suggest other public sector workers would now be queuing up for a 15% rise, stating that the government has 'delivered a better service for passengers' and is 'looking to deliver a better service'.\n",

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen to near 102.70, and 10-year US Treasury yields have dropped to near 3.89%. Market participants are confident about Fed rate cuts, but traders have reduced bets on a 50-basis point (bps) reduction due to improved economic data. The next trigger for the US Dollar will be Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which will provide cues for the interest rate-cut path. Meanwhile, the Euro's appeal remains firm as investors expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to reduce interest rates gradually, although ECB policymakers have refrained from committing to a specific rate-cut path, citing concerns about reaccelerating price pressures.\n",

      "The EUR/USD currency pair is trading around 1.0860 during the Asian session on Friday, extending its gains after rebounding from a two-week low of 1.0825 recorded on Wednesday. The pair is expected to be influenced by the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index for June, which may impact the US Dollar's value. The European Central Bank's policy outlook remains uncertain, which may pose challenges for the Euro. The EUR/USD pair is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% of all transactions.\n",

      "Commerzbank's economists have revised their forecast downwards, expecting a significant decline in the US dollar (USD) in the medium term. According to Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and commodity research, 'We have changed our EUR/USD forecast. We now have to assume USD weakness in the medium term due to the erosion of the US growth advantage and a less active US monetary policy.' As a result, the EUR/USD is expected to rise significantly, with levels around 1.14 possible by mid-2025. However, the picture may change again in the second half of 2025 if the US economy picks up, potentially leading to a more skeptical view of the ECB's monetary policy.\n",

The technical analysis suggests an upward trend with a target of 1.0989, but also a possible downward correction to 1.0827. The trend is expected to continue, with a potential extension of the upward trendline to 1.1151. Please note that these indications are not intended as a trading invitation. \n",

      "The EUR/USD pair ended the week up as the euro rose amid dollar weakness. The US PPI and CPI reports confirmed that inflation was on a consistent path to the 2% target, increasing the likelihood of a 25 bps Fed rate cut in September. This view has kept pressure on the US dollar, boosting the euro. Despite a mixed economic picture, retail sales jumped and jobless claims fell, indicating a resilient economy. Next week, investors will scrutinize policy meeting minutes from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, which may contain clues on the outlook for ECB and Fed rate cuts. The EUR/USD price trades in a bullish channel and has retested the channel resistance, supporting a bullish bias. The next target is at the 1.1051 level, as the direction is up.\n",

ING's analyst Francesco Pesole notes that the OAT:Bund 10-year spread is hovering around 75-80bp, which may be the level it approaches the French election on Sunday. A poll of polls by Bloomberg sees Marine Le Pen's National Rally leading with over 35% and the leftist New Popular Front alliance at 28%. ECB official Olli Rehn was dovish in an interview, saying market pricing for two more rate cuts in 2024 is reasonable. Investors are not heavily influenced by ECB communication, but Rehn's words signal tolerance towards inflation bumps, which is euro-negative. The EUR/USD price action will be determined by French election positioning and Friday's US PCE. ING has a bias for a weakening in the pair to June's lows (1.0670) before a rebound on Friday on encouraging PCE figures.\n",

      "The Euro is currently trading at 0.91 USD in the US market, with a 0.28% fluctuation compared to the previous day. In the last week, the Euro has decreased by 0.57%, and in the last year, it has fallen by 3.43%. The Euro's volatility in the last week is 4.07%, and its annual volatility is 5.95%. According to experts, this indicates that the Euro's behavior is unstable and has many variations in the last year. The Euro's current trend is positive, with a value of 1, indicating an increase in comparison to previous days. This trend may be due to favorable economic factors or increasing demand for the currency. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the Euro's evolution to determine if this trend will persist or reverse in the future. For those who need to transfer dollars from the US to abroad, there are multiple options available, including bank transfers, online transfer services (such as PayPal and Wise), peer-to-peer transfers, check sending, and services like Western Union and MoneyGram. To exchange Euros for US dollars safely, it is recommended to go to banks, authorized currency exchange agencies, airports, or financial institutions like Western Union.\n",

The most recent data shows the USD at around 0.9311 EUR, which is close to but not quite at the 0.935 EUR threshold.
