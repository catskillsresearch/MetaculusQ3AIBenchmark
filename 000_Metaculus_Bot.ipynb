According to a Netflix spokesperson, the leaks were first reported internally before spreading online. Crunchyroll was also affected, with the premiere episode of the isekai anime Re: Zero leaked. 'One of our post-production partners has been compromised, and unfortunately, images of several of our titles have been leaked online,' the spokesperson said. 'Our team is taking energetic measures to have them removed.' The leaks have caused frustration among animators, with one animator tweeting, 'This is our hard work. It is meant to be released on its due date, something we, as animators, really look forward to. It is incredibly disrespectful and just straight up annoying.' The leaks have also led to concerns about spoilers on social media, with fans advised to be cautious and avoid sharing or viewing leaked content. Netflix has taken action to address the leaks, and the official release dates for the affected shows are: Terminator Zero (August 29), Heartstopper Season 3 (October 3), Ranma ½ (October 5), Re: Zero Season 3 (October), Dandadan (October), Spellbound (November 22), Arcane Season 2 (November), and Plankton: The Movie (2025).\n",

According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company plans to reduce its workforce by more than 15% by the end of 2024. Gelsinger acknowledged that the news is 'painful' but necessary to align the company's cost structure with its new operating model. He stated, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected - and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low.' The company will also offer an enhanced retirement program and voluntary departures for eligible employees. This is not the first time Intel has undergone layoffs since the pandemic, with the last round occurring in October 2022.

The company is shifting its focus to faster-growing areas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI). According to Reuters, citing anonymous sources, the layoffs may be similar in scale to the 4,000 employees who were let go in February. The company's quarterly results are expected to be announced on Wednesday, and will likely include details on the new layoffs. As of July 2023, Cisco had around 84,900 employees, not including those who were laid off in February. 'Cisco, the largest manufacturer of routers and switches that direct internet traffic, is struggling with sluggish demand and supply chain constraints in its core business,' Reuters reported.

Subscribers to this plan have until July 13th to choose a new subscription option or lose access to the platform. The company is focusing on ad-supported plans, which already represent around 40% of its subscriptions. This change is a significant shift for Netflix, which previously positioned itself against ads. However, after a record quarterly decline in new subscribers in 2022, the company changed its strategy. The decline was caused by the post-pandemic scenario and global interest rate hikes, forcing tech companies to seek greater efficiency and profitability. Netflix has made various adjustments, including layoffs, the creation of the 'extra point fee', and the introduction of ad-supported plans. These measures have been successful and have inspired competitors like Amazon, Warner, and Disney to adopt similar solutions for their streaming services.\n",

According to Shawn Dahl, service coordinator at the Space Weather Prediction Center, 'Severe levels is pretty extraordinary. It's a very rare event to happen.' The storm may impact Earth's infrastructure, including the power grid, radio communications, and satellite operations. However, there shouldn't be major issues with ATMs, cell phones, or other technology people depend upon, unless power outages occur. The Space Weather Prediction Center activated a hotline to keep power grid operators informed on the latest space weather activity. While it's unlikely to see the northern lights due to the storm's expected decline, there is a slim chance of seeing the aurora in certain states, including Washington, Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota.

However, the magnetosphere will again become excited during the day, with the Kp-index reaching 4 points. On August 14 and 15, the geomagnetic background will be calm, with a Kp-index of 3 points. On the weekends, August 16 and 17, a storm is not expected. However, it is not possible to rule out the possibility of changing the forecast due to increased solar activity and the appearance of new flares.

The storm began in the evening of August 17 and, as Leus noted, after 18:00 Moscow time, the geomagnetic field index Kp exceeded six units, corresponding to a moderate geomagnetic storm of class G1. 'The geomagnetic field disturbances continued to grow, and at 20:46 Moscow time, the geomagnetic storm became strong, class G3,' Leus wrote in his Telegram channel. The storm is a result of a new powerful solar flare that occurred on the Sun on August 14 and is directed towards the Earth.\n",

      "A geomagnetic storm is expected on August 19, 2024, with a force of around 3 points. According to the Solar Astronomy Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the probability of a magnetic storm in the next 24 hours is 25%, and the risk of a strong geomagnetic storm is around 15%. The force of the geomagnetic storm will be 3 points from 6 am to 12 pm, and then it will not exceed 2 points until the end of the day. While powerful magnetic disturbances are not expected, meteorologists will get a small break. It's time to focus on their health. Strengthening the immune system and a healthy lifestyle will help prepare for new solar attacks expected at the end of the month, as said by the authors.\n",

The K-index, a measure of geomagnetic activity, is predicted to be between two and three, indicating a low level of geomagnetic activity. The probability of a magnetic storm is 5% and the probability of a strong magnetic storm is less than 1%. Even people who are not usually sensitive to weather may experience symptoms such as headaches, weakness, sleep problems, blood pressure fluctuations, and tachycardia. To alleviate these symptoms, doctors recommend drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced diet, limiting salt intake, getting enough rest, and spending time outdoors. Additionally, it is advised to avoid physical and emotional overexertion.\n",

      "A magnetic storm of moderate intensity is expected to continue until the end of the day, with a Kp-index of 6. This will affect not only people sensitive to weather changes, but also ordinary citizens. By evening, the storm's intensity is expected to decrease to 4. According to the solar astronomy laboratory, the risk of a G1-class magnetic storm is 25%, while a strong magnetic storm is possible with a probability of 55%. The flare index is in the orange zone, with over 10 flares detected in the past day. During a magnetic storm, people may experience decreased well-being, reduced productivity, and headaches. Doctors recommend reducing workload, avoiding stress, and spending more time outdoors. People with chronic illnesses should not ignore their doctor's instructions.\n",

      "Residents of the region will experience sensitive fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field on August 2, 2024, due to a moderate magnetic storm with a Kp-index of 6. According to meteorologists, the storm will be felt even by healthy people, and those with meteo-sensitivity may experience serious discomfort. The storm is expected to subside in the second half of the day, with the Kp-index dropping to 2. The laboratory of solar astronomy estimates the probability of a strong magnetic storm at 15% and the risk of a magnetic storm at 1%. The authors note that during such events, people often experience nausea, headaches, and exacerbation of chronic diseases. To mitigate these effects, doctors recommend avoiding physical exertion, reducing stress levels, and taking more breaks. Additionally, going for walks in fresh air can be beneficial. As one doctor might say, 'It is essential to prioritize your health during a magnetic storm.'\n",

The geomagnetic disturbances then intensified, and by 20:46 MSK, the storm had reached a strong level of class G3. Leus predicted that the magnetic storms, with fluctuations in intensity from weak to strong, would last on Earth at least until noon on Sunday. A powerful geomagnetic storm had already engulfed the Earth earlier in the week, reaching a level of G4. Following a powerful solar flare on August 14, experts predicted a new magnetic storm.

      "5. Whether the likely event date is before, or on or after the question end date: The likely event date is before the question end date.\n",
      "\n",
      "This estimation is based on the following factors from the provided news:\n",
      "1. Recent strong geomagnetic storms (G3 and G4 level) have been reported.\n",
      "2. Solar activity is currently high, with the Sun at its peak of activity.\n",
      "3. A forecast for August 19-21 mentions a K-index of 4 on August 19, which may indicate continued activity.\n",
      "4. The unpredictable nature of solar flares and resulting geomagnetic storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors, it's likely that a strong geomagnetic storm (K-index > 6) could occur early in the specified period, with August 21 being a reasonable estimate. However, it's important to note that predicting exact dates for such events is challenging due to their inherent variability.\n",
      "27261 80 Rationale: Based on the provided information, there have been multiple recent instances of strong geomagnetic storms (G3 and even G4). Given the high solar activity and the presence of sunspots AR3697, it is quite likely that a geomagnetic storm with a K-index greater than 6 and up to 8 could occur during the period between August 21 and September 11, 2024. However, it is not a certainty, which is why I assign an 80% probability.\n",
      "27262 60 Rationale: While there have been instances of G4-level storms recently and ongoing high solar activity increases the possibility of strong geomagnetic storms, K-index values above 7 are less frequent. Given the data and recent trends, there is a reasonable possibility of a storm in this range, but it is lower than the likelihood of the slightly less severe range. Therefore, I assign a 60% probability to the event of the strongest storm having a K-index greater than 7 and less than or equal to 8.\n",
      "27263 70 Rationale: The prediction of a K-index in the range of greater than 6 and less than or equal to 7 is slightly higher than the range greater than 7 and less than or equal to 8 due to the frequency and recent data showing moderate to strong storm activities. With the ongoing high activity and recent patterns, it is likely that the storm could fall within this range, albeit with slightly less probability than the broader range that includes higher values. Therefore, I assign a 70% probability to this scenario.\n",

The probability for K-index > 6 and ≤ 7 might be underrepresented.\n",

Bezos' personal fortune has grown significantly, making him the second richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $210 billion (194 billion euros), according to Forbes. Bezos was the richest person in the world from 2018 to 2021, but is now surpassed by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X, with a net worth of $221 billion (204 billion euros). Bezos' fortune comes mainly from Amazon, which he founded as an online bookstore. He has sold over $27 billion (25 billion euros) worth of Amazon shares since the company went public in 1997 and now owns less than 10% of the company. Bezos has made headlines in recent years for his massive earnings, including a record-breaking $13 billion (12 billion euros) in a single day in 2020.\n",

Elon Musk, owner of Tesla, has maintained his top spot, while Warren Buffett has fallen to 10th place due to his large donations. Buffett distributed approximately $5.3 billion in Berkshire Hathaway shares in late June and saw a slight decrease in the value of his shares, marking the first time in years he has fallen so far in the rankings. Bernard Arnault, the French luxury goods king, has fallen to third place due to the decline in LVMH stock, while Jeff Bezos has risen to second place after Amazon's market value surpassed $2 trillion for the first time in June. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, has seen his wealth increase by $26.8 billion after Oracle's stock reached an all-time high, making him the biggest gainer in June, as he said, 'It was a great day for Oracle.' \n",

      "Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary today, July 5, 2024. Behind the giant is Jeff Bezos, a well-known figure who embodies the American myth of the small entrepreneur who started from scratch and is now one of the richest men in the world. The story begins in a garage in Seattle, where Bezos created Amazon in 1994. He shared a video on his Instagram account showing his early technical installations, a computer and a photocopier. Bezos, a passionate reader and computer scientist, left his job on Wall Street to start Amazon, which initially focused on creating the world's largest bookstore. The company's growth was rapid, and in 1997, Amazon went public. Since then, Bezos has sold over $27 billion worth of Amazon shares, making him one of the richest people in the world. Today, he is the second richest person on the planet, with a fortune estimated by Forbes to be $210 billion. He has also invested in various companies, including Google, Uber, and Airbnb, and has developed new projects such as a streaming service and a space tourism company, Blue Origin.\n",

      "The question is about Jeff Bezos' wealth ranking on a specific date (September 30, 2024), which is a future event. Based on the provided news, here's the analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. As of the most recent updates, Jeff Bezos is consistently reported as the second richest person in the world, behind Elon Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bezos' net worth is reported to be between $186 billion and $214 billion, depending on the source and date of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The rankings have shown some fluctuation, with Bernard Arnault occasionally taking the second or third position.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Amazon's recent performance, including surpassing $2 trillion in market value, has contributed to Bezos' wealth and ranking.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The most recent Forbes list for 2024 (as of July) still shows Bezos in the second position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors, it's most likely that Jeff Bezos will maintain his position as the second richest person in the world on September 30, 2024. However, it's important to note that wealth rankings can change rapidly due to stock market fluctuations and other economic factors. The date in question is only about 6 weeks from the current date, which isn't a long time for significant changes in wealth rankings at this level.\n",
      "27258 90 Given the current information and recent trends, Jeff Bezos is likely to maintain his position as the second richest person in the world by September 30, 2024. His net worth and ranking are supported by Amazon's strong financial performance and his significant wealth cushion. While market changes and fluctuations can occur, the short time frame of six weeks makes it less probable for major shifts to displace him from his second position.\n",
      "REFINING 27258\n",
      "Pass 0 of 4 on 27258\n",
      "27258 The rationale doesn't fully justify the high probability of 90%. Market changes and fluctuations can occur rapidly, especially considering the volatile nature of stock markets and individual wealth fluctuations. Ensure the rationale appropriately considers potential competition from other billionaires, market dynamics, and other intervening variables that could impact rankings.\n",
      "27258 80 You're correct that the volatile nature of stock markets and other intervening variables could impact the rankings more than originally accounted for. Given Jeff Bezos' consistent ranking as the second richest person and Amazon's strong performance, he is still highly likely to be in the top two positions. However, the potential for rapid changes should moderately reduce the probability. Thus, a probability of 80% is more appropriate to reflect these considerations.\n",

      "Forecast 80\n",
      "Rationale You're correct that the volatile nature of stock markets and other intervening variables could impact the rankings more than originally accounted for. Given Jeff Bezos' consistent ranking as the second richest person and Amazon's strong performance, he is still highly likely to be in the top two positions.

      "27259 Before October 1, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Netflix?\n",
      "Forecast 30\n",
      "Rationale The current news does not specifically indicate that Netflix is planning layoffs, and Netflix has not been prominently affected compared to other tech companies. While the overall trend in the tech industry shows a high number of layoffs due to various economic pressures, Netflix's focus in the news has been on dealing with content leaks rather than restructuring. Given that tech companies are making adjustments, a layoff announcement by Netflix is plausible but not certain within the given timeframe. Thus, I assign a 30% probability to the event of Tech Crunch reporting new layoffs at Netflix before October 1, 2024. \n",

      "27260 Will Big Lots file for bankruptcy before September 30, 2024?\n",

      "Rationale Given the significant financial difficulties Big Lots is facing—such as declining sales, increased debt, store closures, and expressed doubt about continued operations—it seems highly probable the company will seek bankruptcy protection before September 30, 2024. The retail industry is currently under significant strain, and other major chains have already filed for bankruptcy or closed many stores. With all these factors considered, the likelihood of Big Lots filing for bankruptcy within the next 42 days is high. A probability of 85% reflects this imminent risk. \n",

      "Forecast 80\n",
      "Rationale Rationale: Based on the provided information, there have been multiple recent instances of strong geomagnetic storms (G3 and even G4). Given the high solar activity and the presence of sunspots AR3697, it is quite likely that a geomagnetic storm with a K-index greater than 6 and up to 8 could occur during the period between August 21 and September 11, 2024. However, it is not a certainty, which is why I assign an 80% probability. \n",

      "27262 Between August 21 and Sept 11, 2024, will the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index (\"Kp\") greater than 7 and less than or equal to 8?\n",
      "Forecast 60\n",
      "Rationale Rationale: While there have been instances of G4-level storms recently and ongoing high solar activity increases the possibility of strong geomagnetic storms, K-index values above 7 are less frequent. Given the data and recent trends, there is a reasonable possibility of a storm in this range, but it is lower than the likelihood of the slightly less severe range. Therefore, I assign a 60% probability to the event of the strongest storm having a K-index greater than 7 and less than or equal to 8. \n",

      "Forecast 75\n",
      "Rationale Rationale: Upon reassessment, the probability for K-index values greater than 6 and less than or equal to 7 should indeed be higher than 70% considering the overall probability distribution and the given probabilities for other ranges. Given the recent trend of high solar activity and the multiple strong geomagnetic storms, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability for K-index values greater than 6 and less than or equal to 7. Thus, I adjust it to 75%. \n",
