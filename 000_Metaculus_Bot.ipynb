      "Rationale Given the reiterated statements from Donald Trump that he does not intend to sell his shares, and the subsequent market reaction implying trust in his declaration, the probability of him selling any shares before October 1, 2024, remains low. However, considering the volatility of circumstances surrounding Trump's business decisions and public remarks, a minimal probability still exists, hence a cautious estimate. \n",

      "Forecast 10\n",
      "Rationale USDA recalls, particularly involving allergens, often remain active for extended periods to ensure thorough remediation actions and broad notification of potential issues. Given that recalls mentioned in the news, such as the Boar's Head recall, are ongoing and have not been resolved promptly despite significant health impacts, it is unlikely that the recall for Michael Foods Inc.'s liquid egg products will be closed before October 1, 2024. Therefore, the probability of closure happening in the remaining timeframe is quite low. \n",

      "Forecast 72\n",
      "Rationale Given the current economic context as described in the news, the yield curve has shown tendencies of re-inverting after brief periods of normalcy. Historical behavior and recent data suggest that such a trend may continue, especially with the upcoming Federal Reserve decisions and market volatility. Therefore, there is a substantial probability that the yield curve will be inverted on September 27, 2024. \n",

      "Forecast 15\n",
      "Rationale Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly stated that he does not intend to sell any shares. Given the backlash and potential negative impact on the stock price if he were to sell, combined with his current political ambitions and the potential negative publicity, it is unlikely that he will sell shares before October 1, 2024. However, there is always some level of uncertainty with public figures and corporate decisions. \n",

      "Forecast 95\n",
      "Rationale Given the recent news and historical trends regarding yield curve inversion, it is highly likely that the yield curve will remain inverted by September 27, 2024. The brief return to a non-inverted state has been followed by a quick re-inversion, and expectations of further Fed actions imply continued volatility and potential inversion. Historical data also supports persistent inversion in the periods before a recession. \n",

      "Forecast 10\n",
      "Rationale Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of selling his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group. Given his consistent public declarations and the fact that selling off a substantial amount of shares could negatively affect his political standing and the stock price, it seems highly unlikely he will sell any shares before October 1, 2024. However, the possibility still exists, albeit low. \n",

      "Forecast 15\n",
      "Rationale Based on the pattern and details from similar cases detailed in the news, significant food safety recalls involving major allergens like milk usually require thorough investigation and corrective actions that extend beyond a three-month period. Therefore, I predict a low probability that the recall will be resolved and marked as closed before October 1, 2024. \n",

      "28245 Will the yield curve be inverted on Friday September 27, 2024?\n",
      "Forecast 60\n",
      "Rationale The yield curve has shown recent inversions and brief un-inversions, reflecting market instability and mixed economic signals. Given the recent brief reversion to a positive yield curve and subsequent return to inversion, alongside factors such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, there's a significant chance the inversion could persist ten days from now. Therefore, a probability of 60% for inversion on September 27, 2024, seems reasonable given the current data and economic outlook. \n",

      "Rationale Given Donald Trump's explicit statements across multiple platforms that he has no intention of selling his shares, and considering the market reaction to these statements, it is highly unlikely that he will reverse his position and sell shares before October 1, 2024.

      "Rationale Given that recalls can remain active for extended periods as investigations continue and safety measures are enforced, it is uncertain whether the USDA-posted recall will be closed before October 1, 2024.

      "Rationale Given the current continuous fluctuations and inversions observed, it is more likely that the yield curve will revert to being inverted by September 27, 2024. Historical precedent shows that brief periods of normality are often followed by a return to inversion, especially in uncertain economic conditions. The probability reflects the high likelihood but also acknowledges the recent temporary return to a normal yield curve configuration. \n",
