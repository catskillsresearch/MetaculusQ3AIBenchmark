Diesel fuel prices remain stable at 19.06 lei/liter. According to the National Agency for Energy Regulation, the decrease in pump prices was due to lower Platts quotations and a strong leu/dollar exchange rate. However, with recent changes in these factors, the Agency notes that 'This fact in the next period can lead to price recovery.' The Agency will continue to monitor international oil exchanges and ensure the transparency and accuracy of fuel price calculations.\n",

      "US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will appear on Thursday to rally their main supporters. Harris will participate in a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, while Trump will attend a event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing the US-Israeli Council. Winfrey, a Harris supporter, will host a two-hour live stream in Michigan, 'Unite for America', highlighting the dozens of grassroots groups supporting Harris. Trump will speak at a nighttime event, 'Fighting antisemitism in the US', alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks and widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Trump will also address the US-Israeli Council, a non-profit organization supported by Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, a prominent donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The Council is holding its national convention in the weeks leading up to the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. The 'Uncommitted' protest movement, which opposes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, has announced it will not support Harris but urged its supporters to vote against Trump. The group, which received hundreds of thousands of votes in the Democratic primaries this year, has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US arms shipments to Israel. 'Uncommitted' warned that some Democratic voters may stay home in November, particularly in states like Michigan. Harris' campaign team did not directly address the group's announcement, but stated that the candidate 'will continue to work towards ending the war in Gaza in a way that ensures Israel's security, the release of hostages, an end to suffering in Gaza, and the Palestinian people's right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination'.\n",

      "The tech industry is currently undergoing a significant reset, with thousands of employees being laid off and hiring requirements being tightened. According to Layoffs.fyi, over 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies since the start of the year. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have downsized, and employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, with an average increase of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. As Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, said, 'The market isn't what it once was.' Companies are now focusing on revenue-generating products and services, and are looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, with individuals who have worked on large language models being offered salaries reaching $1 million a year.\n",

      "28303 70 The national average gas price is $3.24, and even with a decreasing trend, it should stay above $3.10 by September 30, 2024. The price is expected to fall but not sufficiently to drop below $3.10 within the given timeframe.\n",
      "28304 10 Given the current average of $3.24 and the declining trend, it is highly unlikely that the price will be above $3.30 by the end of the month. The probability is very low due to consistent recent declines.\n",

Diesel fuel prices remain stable at 19.06 lei/liter. According to the National Agency for Energy Regulation, the decrease in pump prices was due to lower Platts quotations and a strong leu/dollar exchange rate. However, with recent changes in these factors, the Agency notes that 'This fact in the next period can lead to price recovery.' The Agency will continue to monitor international oil exchanges and ensure the transparency and accuracy of fuel price calculations.\n",

      "The tech industry is currently undergoing a significant reset, with thousands of employees being laid off and hiring requirements being tightened. According to Layoffs.fyi, over 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies since the start of the year. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have downsized, and employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, with an average increase of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. As Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, said, 'The market isn't what it once was.' Companies are now focusing on revenue-generating products and services, and are looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, with individuals who have worked on large language models being offered salaries reaching $1 million a year.\n",

      "US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will appear on Thursday to rally their main supporters. Harris will participate in a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, while Trump will attend a event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing the US-Israeli Council. Winfrey, a Harris supporter, will host a two-hour live stream in Michigan, 'Unite for America', highlighting the dozens of grassroots groups supporting Harris. Trump will speak at a nighttime event, 'Fighting antisemitism in the US', alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks and widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Trump will also address the US-Israeli Council, a non-profit organization supported by Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, a prominent donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The Council is holding its national convention in the weeks leading up to the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. The 'Uncommitted' protest movement, which opposes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, has announced it will not support Harris but urged its supporters to vote against Trump. The group, which received hundreds of thousands of votes in the Democratic primaries this year, has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US arms shipments to Israel. 'Uncommitted' warned that some Democratic voters may stay home in November, particularly in states like Michigan. Harris' campaign team did not directly address the group's announcement, but stated that the candidate 'will continue to work towards ending the war in Gaza in a way that ensures Israel's security, the release of hostages, an end to suffering in Gaza, and the Palestinian people's right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination'.\n",

      "US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will appear on Thursday to rally their main supporters. Harris will participate in a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, while Trump will attend a event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing the US-Israeli Council. Winfrey, a Harris supporter, will host a two-hour live stream in Michigan, 'Unite for America', highlighting the dozens of grassroots groups supporting Harris. Trump will speak at a nighttime event, 'Fighting antisemitism in the US', alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks and widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Trump will also address the US-Israeli Council, a non-profit organization supported by Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, a prominent donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The Council is holding its national convention in the weeks leading up to the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. The 'Uncommitted' protest movement, which opposes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, has announced it will not support Harris but urged its supporters to vote against Trump. The group, which received hundreds of thousands of votes in the Democratic primaries this year, has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US arms shipments to Israel. 'Uncommitted' warned that some Democratic voters may stay home in November, particularly in states like Michigan. Harris' campaign team did not directly address the group's announcement, but stated that the candidate 'will continue to work towards ending the war in Gaza in a way that ensures Israel's security, the release of hostages, an end to suffering in Gaza, and the Palestinian people's right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination'.\n",

      "The tech industry is currently undergoing a significant reset, with thousands of employees being laid off and hiring requirements being tightened. According to Layoffs.fyi, over 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies since the start of the year. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have downsized, and employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, with an average increase of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. As Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, said, 'The market isn't what it once was.' Companies are now focusing on revenue-generating products and services, and are looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, with individuals who have worked on large language models being offered salaries reaching $1 million a year.\n",

Diesel fuel prices remain stable at 19.06 lei/liter. According to the National Agency for Energy Regulation, the decrease in pump prices was due to lower Platts quotations and a strong leu/dollar exchange rate.

      "US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will appear on Thursday to rally their main supporters. Harris will participate in a live stream with Oprah Winfrey, while Trump will attend a event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing the US-Israeli Council. Winfrey, a Harris supporter, will host a two-hour live stream in Michigan, 'Unite for America', highlighting the dozens of grassroots groups supporting Harris. Trump will speak at a nighttime event, 'Fighting antisemitism in the US', alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks and widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Trump will also address the US-Israeli Council, a non-profit organization supported by Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, a prominent donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The Council is holding its national convention in the weeks leading up to the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. The 'Uncommitted' protest movement, which opposes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, has announced it will not support Harris but urged its supporters to vote against Trump. The group, which received hundreds of thousands of votes in the Democratic primaries this year, has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US arms shipments to Israel. 'Uncommitted' warned that some Democratic voters may stay home in November, particularly in states like Michigan. Harris' campaign team did not directly address the group's announcement, but stated that the candidate 'will continue to work towards ending the war in Gaza in a way that ensures Israel's security, the release of hostages, an end to suffering in Gaza, and the Palestinian people's right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination'.\n",

      "The tech industry is currently undergoing a significant reset, with thousands of employees being laid off and hiring requirements being tightened. According to Layoffs.fyi, over 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies since the start of the year. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020. Companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have downsized, and employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, with an average increase of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. As Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, said, 'The market isn't what it once was.' Companies are now focusing on revenue-generating products and services, and are looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, with individuals who have worked on large language models being offered salaries reaching $1 million a year.\n",

      "After a 10-week decline, the price of COR 95 gasoline has started to increase. Over the next three days, gasoline will be sold for 22.36 lei/liter, a 0.07 lei increase from Friday. Diesel fuel prices remain stable at 19.06 lei/liter. According to the National Agency for Energy Regulation, the decrease in pump prices was due to lower Platts quotations and a strong leu/dollar exchange rate. However, with recent changes in these factors, the Agency notes that 'This fact in the next period can lead to price recovery.' The Agency will continue to monitor international oil exchanges and ensure the transparency and accuracy of fuel price calculations.\n",

      "28303 85 Based on recent trends and the projected rate of decline in gas prices, it is expected that the price will remain above $3.10 on September 30, 2024. The current rate of decrease suggests a likely price point around $3.154, which is comfortably above $3.10.\n",
      "28304 5 Given the current price of $3.24 and the expected trend of decreasing prices, the price is highly likely to be below $3.30 on September 30, 2024. The projected price is around $3.154, well below the $3.30 mark.\n",
      "28305 1 Given the current downward trend and the estimated rate of decrease, it is extremely unlikely that the price will be above $3.40 on September 30, 2024. The projected price of $3.154 makes it almost certain to be below $3.40.\n",
      "28306 15 Although the trend points towards decreasing prices, reaching below $3.00 seems less likely given the current price of $3.24 and the estimated rate of decline.

      "Rationale Given that there's no current announcement or plans indicating that any of the listed prominent Democrats will be appearing on Lex Fridman's podcast before October 1, 2024, the likelihood seems low.
