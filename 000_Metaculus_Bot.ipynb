       "1. **Challenges and Delays**: Revolut initially applied for the license in January 2021 but has faced numerous obstacles, including concerns about its size (nearly 8 million customers in the U.K.), financial reporting, and the departure of senior executives.\n",

       "3. **External Factors**: Banking turmoil, including the collapse of several banks in March, has made regulators more cautious. The current economic climate also raises concerns about FinTech companies' ability to raise capital if needed, contributing to a more stringent approach from regulators during the application process.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Optimism and Progress**: Despite the challenges, Revolut maintains an optimistic outlook regarding its chances of obtaining a U.K. banking license.

       "\n",
       "## Superforecaster\n",
       "\n",
       "### Rationale\n",
       "\n",
       "Revolut's efforts to obtain a UK banking license have been ongoing for several years, fraught with various challenges, particularly concerning regulatory scrutiny around anti-money laundering (AML) practices and its complex capital structure. However, recent developments indicate progress:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Regulatory Engagement**: Revolut has been in serious discussions with UK regulators, which implies a dedicated attempt to meet their requirements. The October 2023 agreement to collapse share classes shows a commitment to simplifying the capital structure, which could address one of the major regulatory hurdles.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Financial Performance**: The company's strong financial performance, including significant growth in revenue and pre-tax profits, enhances its credibility and indicates operational stability, which is a favorable signal to regulators.\n",
       "   \n",
       "3. **Management Actions**: Expanding the board to include directors with more technology and banking expertise aligns with the Prudential Regulation Authority’s (PRA) requirements, showing a willingness to conform to suggested best practices.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **CEO's Optimism**: The CEO’s confidence, although subjective, suggests that internal assessments about meeting regulatory conditions are promising.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Comparative Success**: The successful acquisition of banking licenses in other jurisdictions, such as the EU banking license from the Bank of Lithuania, provides some precedent that Revolut can meet stringent regulatory requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **External Climate**: While the overall banking sector's cautious stance could pose additional obstacles, Revolut’s existing scale and track record may offset some of these risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given these points, along with ongoing challenges such as exact compliance with AML regulations and the economic climate posing general risks, the likelihood of Revolut securing a UK banking license by the specified date is moderate but optimistic.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Probability: 70%\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Your Friend's Feedback\n",
       "Friend: \"You make some good points, but I think you might be overlooking the broader regulatory environment and the potential for unforeseen delays. Regulatory bodies can be very unpredictable, and Revolut's past issues with AML compliance aren't trivial. Also, the current economic climate is making regulators exceedingly cautious. Shouldn't that weigh more heavily in your analysis?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Reconsidered Rationale and Forecast\n",
       "\n",
       "You raise valid concerns. Regulatory bodies can indeed be unpredictable, and the broader cautious climate due to recent banking turmoil and economic uncertainty might lead to additional delays. Furthermore, AML compliance issues could still be a significant roadblock despite Revolut’s efforts to address them. This environment may warrant a more conservative forecast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Reevaluating the weight of these potential obstacles alongside Revolut's strong financial performance and management’s strategic moves, the likelihood remains promising but certainly carries more risk than initially considered.\n",

       " ]\n",
       "The background is: [ In recent years, a number of ventures have begun work on translating the results of some promising laboratory studies on senolytic agents into medicine for humans.\n",
       "\n",
       "A senolytic agent is an agent introduced to the body for the purpose of selectively eliminating senescent cells from the patient. Senescent cells are cells in the body that no longer divide, having reached their Hayflick limit, but which do not automatically apoptose. \n",
       "\n",
       "These senescent cells linger in the body triggering inflammatory responses, reducing the effectiveness of the immune system, and they are associated with many age-related diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis which present a high disease and mortality burden, especially in the most-developed countries in which age-related diseases constitute the overwhelming majority of causes of death among populations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Senescent cells are thought to play an important part in the aging process, and thus it is theorised that selectively removing these senescent cells would significantly improve healthspan (and perhaps, alone or as part of a combinatorial therapy, significantly extend lifespan).\n",

       "One major player in this quickly developing area of medicine is [Unity Biotechnology](https://unitybiotechnology.com/).

       "\n",
       "The FDA has approved several novel drugs in 2024, but none of them are specifically senolytic therapies for Alzheimer's disease or other age-related diseases.

       "Clinical trials, such as the one conducted by Gonzales et al., have shown promising results in terms of safety, tolerability, and feasibility, but these studies are still in the early stages, and larger, fully powered, placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and potential for disease modification.\n",
       "\n",

While there is active research and some clinical trials showing promising results, there are several stages of clinical trials and regulatory processes that need to be successfully navigated. This usually takes several years, particularly for cutting-edge therapies.\n",

       "- **Company Statements**: The company's intent to seek advice, while aiming not to restructure, suggests they are making efforts to avoid bankruptcy.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Historical Frequency**: The historical frequency of two confirmed interstellar objects in six years is a good starting point. However, it's essential to recognize that these discoveries were made with existing technology. The upcoming enhancements in detection capabilities, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, might significantly alter the frequency of detections.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Enhanced Capabilities**: The improved detection capabilities of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the James Webb Space Telescope are crucial in increasing the chances of detecting interstellar objects. This factor should be given significant weight in the probability assessment.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Detection Rate**: The detection rate is indeed low, but it's crucial to consider that the detection rate might increase with the new technologies. This could lead to a higher probability of detecting another interstellar object within the next year and a half.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Uncertainty in Population Estimates**: The uncertainty in population estimates is a significant factor. While there are estimates of around 10,000 'Oumuamua-size interstellar objects within the orbit of Neptune, these estimates are based on current understanding and might be refined as more data becomes available.\n",
       "\n",
       "Considering these factors, I think the assigned probability of 65% might be slightly high. While the enhanced detection capabilities and historical frequency support a higher probability, the uncertainty in population estimates and the rarity of these objects should temper the optimism. I would suggest a revised probability of around 55% to 60%.\n",

       "2. **Enhanced Capabilities**: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's ability to conduct large-scale, frequent surveys and the James Webb Space Telescope's high sensitivity are both powerful factors that suggest an improved detection rate. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Detection Rate and Advances**: The potential increase in the detection rate, given new technology, is a significant positive factor that should be weighed appropriately.\n",
