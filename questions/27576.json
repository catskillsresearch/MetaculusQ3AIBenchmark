The US, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Canada have supplied Israel with weapons since the beginning of the war, though Canada, Italy, and the Netherlands [halted arms sales to Israel in early 2024](https://www.reuters.com/world/who-are-israels-main-weapons-suppliers-who-has-halted-exports-2024-05-09/).\n\nBut as the war approaches one year of duration and Israel has [expanded into other regions in Gaza](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4660135-israel-moves-deeper-into-rafah/), the international mood may be shifting against Israel.
